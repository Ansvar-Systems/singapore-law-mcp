(5) Any driver or rider of any vehicle commits an offence if — ( a ) he or she is ordered under subsection (2) by a police officer — (i) to proceed towards the barrier and stop the vehicle at or near, or before reaching the barrier; and (ii) to remain in the vehicle and keep the vehicle stationary until permitted by a police officer to proceed; and ( b ) he or she fails — (i) to proceed towards the barrier and stop the vehicle at or near, or before reaching the barrier; or (ii) to remain in the vehicle and keep the vehicle stationary until permitted by a police officer to proceed.

[10/2015] (7) In every case where an appeal has been made under subsection (6) against any order under subsection (2), (3)( a ), (3A)( b ), (4) or (5), the punishment awarded by that order must be suspended pending the determination of the appeal. [10/2015] (8) A Disciplinary Appeal Committee may determine an appeal under subsection (6) against an order of a disciplinary officer — ( a ) by confirming any finding of guilt or punishment ordered by the disciplinary officer; ( b ) by quashing any finding of guilt or punishment ordered by the disciplinary officer and, if the Disciplinary Appeal Committee is of the opinion that the case against the appellant should be re‑tried, by ordering the case to be re‑tried by another disciplinary officer; ( c ) by replacing any finding by the disciplinary officer that, in the opinion of the Disciplinary Appeal Committee, is illegal or cannot be supported by the evidence with a new finding that could validly have been made by the disciplinary officer on the charge and on the facts; or ( d ) by varying the punishment by way of enhancement, reduction, substitution or otherwise except that no greater or more severe punishment is to be ordered unless the appellant has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard, and the decision of the Disciplinary Appeal Committee in any such appeal is final.

(4) As soon as may be practicable after the end of the period of mobilisation of any property used by an auxiliary police officer that was supplied by the auxiliary police officer’s employer, there must be given or sent to the employer of the officer, by such person and in such form and manner as aforesaid, a notice — ( a ) stating whether any, and if so what, damage to the property has occurred during the period of mobilisation (other than damage which has been made good by the Commissioner) or that the total loss of the property has occurred; ( b ) specifying the compensation, or the rate or amount thereof, offered in respect of the damage or loss; and ( c ) specifying the effect of subsection (6). (5) A person to whom a receipt or notice under subsection (3) or (4) has been given or sent (called in this Act the claimant) is deemed to have accepted the offer contained in the receipt or notice unless he or she notifies the Commissioner, within 4 weeks after he or she receives the receipt or notice, of his or her claim for a greater amount or rate. (6) Where a notice under subsection (4) has been given or sent stating that no damage has occurred to any property during the period of mobilisation, the claimant is deemed to have agreed that no damage has so occurred unless he or she notifies the Commissioner, within 4 weeks after he or she receives the notice, of his or her claim that damage has so occurred and stating the compensation he or she claims in respect of the damage. (7) On the receipt of a claim under subsection (5) or (6), the Commissioner may notify the claimant that the Commissioner does not propose to make any further offer or that the Commissioner makes a specified further offer. (8) Before making any compensation under this Act, the Commissioner may require reasonable particulars of the damage to any property which was supplied by the employer to the auxiliary police officer during mobilisation and of the circumstances in which it occurred and may require a reasonable opportunity to be afforded to a person authorised by the Commissioner to inspect the property. (9) Nothing in this section operates so as to require the making of any payment of compensation before the end of the period of mobilisation of any property."
