(3) If the arbitral tribunal is satisfied that there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay on the part of the claimant in pursuing the claimant’s claim, and the delay — ( a ) gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a substantial risk that it is not possible to have a fair resolution of the issues in that claim; or ( b ) has caused, or is likely to cause, serious prejudice to the respondent, the tribunal may make an award dismissing the claim."

(3) Any application or appeal must be brought within 28 days of the date of the award or, if there has been any arbitral process of appeal or review, of the date when the applicant or appellant was notified of the result of that process. (4) If on an application or appeal it appears to the Court that the award — ( a ) does not contain the arbitral tribunal’s reasons; or ( b ) does not set out the arbitral tribunal’s reasons in sufficient detail to enable the Court to properly consider the application or appeal, the Court may order the arbitral tribunal to state the reasons for its award in sufficient detail for that purpose. (5) Where the Court makes an order under subsection (4), it may make any further order that it thinks fit with respect to any additional costs of the arbitration resulting from its order. (6) The Court may order the applicant or appellant to provide security for the costs of the application or appeal, and may direct that the application or appeal be dismissed if the order is not complied with. (7) The power to order security for costs must not be exercised by reason only that the applicant or appellant is — ( a ) an individual ordinarily resident outside Singapore; or ( b ) a corporation or association incorporated or formed under the law of a country outside Singapore or whose central management and control is exercised outside Singapore. (8) The Court may order that any money payable under the award must be brought into Court or otherwise secured pending the determination of the application or appeal, and may direct that the application or appeal be dismissed if the order is not complied with. (9) The Court may grant permission to appeal subject to conditions to the same or similar effect as an order under subsection (6) or (8) and this does not affect the general discretion of the Court to grant permission subject to conditions.
