(4) Subsection (3)( b ) does not apply to intervention or any step taken for the purpose only of — ( a ) claiming immunity; or ( b ) asserting an interest in property in circumstances such that the State would have been entitled to immunity if the proceedings had been brought against it. (5) Subsection (3)( b ) does not apply to any step taken by the State in ignorance of facts entitling it to immunity if those facts could not reasonably have been ascertained and immunity is claimed as soon as reasonably practicable. (6) A submission in respect of any proceedings extends to any appeal but not to any counterclaim unless it arises out of the same legal relationship or facts as the claim. (7) The head of a State’s diplomatic mission in Singapore, or the person for the time being performing his or her functions, is deemed to have authority to submit on behalf of the State in respect of any proceedings; and any person who has entered into a contract on behalf of and with the authority of a State is deemed to have authority to submit on its behalf in respect of proceedings arising out of the contract."
