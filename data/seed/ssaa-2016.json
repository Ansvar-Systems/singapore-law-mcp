(2) For the purposes of this section and sections 57C and 57D, a funding arrangement is an abusive funding arrangement if the funding arrangement, or a transaction forming part of the funding arrangement, results or would result in a person obtaining — ( a ) an incentive, a grant or a loan from the Agency that a person would otherwise not be eligible for or would not have obtained from the Agency; or ( b ) an amount of an incentive, a grant or a loan from the Agency higher than what a person would have been eligible for or would have obtained without that arrangement or transaction.

(2) A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (1) shall on conviction — ( a ) pay a penalty equal to the amount of wrongly obtained funding that the person obtained, or would have obtained, from the Agency as a result of the abusive funding arrangement entered into or facilitated by the person; and ( b ) be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)( a ), it is irrelevant whether the person convicted of the offence obtained the wrongly obtained funding from the Agency for the benefit of that person, or for the benefit of any other person or persons. (4) The penalty mentioned in subsection (2)( a ) is recoverable in accordance with section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (other than section 319(1)( a )) as if it were a fine.

(6) However, a person does not facilitate a funding arrangement under subsection (5) only by reason that the person in the ordinary course of business — ( a ) provides services relating to, or provides connections for, the transmission or routing of data; ( b ) provides, or operates facilities for, online services or network access; or ( c ) provides a service that — (i) enables the end-users of that service to communicate with other end-users; or (ii) enables the publication, dissemination or communication of information or documents by end-users of that service, whether by means of email, by use of a mobile telephone or other device, or by use of application software or otherwise. (7) In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1), it is presumed, until the contrary is proved, that a person has the intention mentioned in subsection (1)( c ) if the funding arrangement, or a transaction forming part of the funding arrangement, involves any step or steps (other than under subsection (6)) which is or are capable of assisting the person or any other person who enters into that funding arrangement or transaction to obtain the incentive, grant or loan. (8) To avoid doubt, it is not a defence in any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) that the accused did not obtain any incentive, grant or loan from the Agency.

(5) Until such time as conditions of employment are drawn up by the Agency for the transferred employees, every transferred employee is to be regarded as being employed by the Agency on the same conditions of employment applicable to the employee on the eve of the transfer date as the Singapore Workforce Development Agency. (6) Any condition of employment relating to the length of service with the Agency must recognise the length of service of the employees so transferred while employed by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (including any previous service of the employee taken to be service with the Singapore Workforce Development Agency) to be service with the Agency.
