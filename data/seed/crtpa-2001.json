      "title": "Right of third party to enforce contractual term",
      "content": "2. —(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person who is not a party to a contract (called in this Act a third party) may, in the third party’s own right, enforce a term of the contract if — ( a ) the contract expressly provides that the third party may; or ( b ) subject to subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on the third party. (2) Subsection (1)( b ) does not apply if, on a proper construction of the contract, it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party. (3) The third party must be expressly identified in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as answering a particular description, but need not be in existence when the contract is entered into. (4) This section does not confer a right on a third party to enforce a term of a contract otherwise than subject to and in accordance with any other relevant terms of the contract. (5) For the purpose of exercising a third party’s right to enforce a term of the contract, there is to be available to the third party any remedy that would have been available to the third party in an action for breach of contract if the third party had been a party to the contract (and the rules relating to damages, injunctions, specific performance and other remedy apply accordingly) and such remedy must not be refused on the ground that, as against the promisor, the third party is a volunteer. (6) Where a term of a contract excludes or limits liability in relation to any matter, references in this Act to the third party enforcing the term are to be construed as references to the third party availing himself, herself or itself of the exclusion or limitation. (7) In this Act, in relation to a term of a contract which is enforceable by a third party — “promisee” means the party to the contract by whom the term is enforceable against the promisor; “promisor” means the party to the contract against whom the term is enforceable by the third party."

      "content": "3. —(1) Subject to this section, where a third party has a right under section 2 to enforce a term of the contract, the parties to the contract may not, by agreement, rescind the contract, or vary the contract in such a way as to extinguish or alter the third party’s entitlement under that right, without the third party’s consent if — ( a ) the third party has communicated the third party’s assent to the term to the promisor; ( b ) the promisor is aware that the third party has relied on the term (whether or not the third party has knowledge of its precise terms); or ( c ) the promisor can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term and the third party has in fact relied on the term (whether or not the third party has knowledge of its precise terms). (2) The assent mentioned in subsection (1)( a ) — ( a ) may be by words or conduct; and ( b ) if sent to the promisor by post or other means, is not to be regarded as communicated to the promisor until the assent is received by the promisor. (3) Subsection (1) is subject to any express term of the contract under which — ( a ) the parties to the contract may by agreement rescind or vary the contract without the consent of the third party; or ( b ) the consent of the third party is required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of those set out in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) and ( c ). (4) Where the consent of a third party is required under subsection (1) or (3), the court or arbitral tribunal may, on the application of the parties to the contract, dispense with such consent if the court or tribunal is satisfied that — ( a ) the consent cannot be obtained because the third party’s whereabouts cannot reasonably be ascertained; or ( b ) the third party is mentally incapable of giving the third party’s consent. (5) The court or arbitral tribunal may, on the application of the parties to a contract, dispense with any consent that may be required under subsection (1)( c ) if it is satisfied that it cannot reasonably be ascertained whether or not the third party has in fact relied on the term of the contract. (6) If the court or arbitral tribunal dispenses with a third party’s consent, it may impose such conditions as it thinks fit, including a condition requiring the payment of compensation to the third party. (7) The jurisdiction conferred on the court by subsections (4), (5) and (6) is exercisable by both the General Division of the High Court and a District Court. [40/2019]"

(2) The promisor has available to the promisor, by way of defence or set‑off, any matter that — ( a ) arises from or in connection with the contract and is relevant to the term; and ( b ) would have been available to the promisor by way of defence or set-off if the proceedings had been brought by the promisee. (3) The promisor also has available to the promisor, by way of defence or set‑off, any matter if — ( a ) an express term of the contract provides for it to be available to the promisor in proceedings brought by the third party; and ( b ) it would have been available to the promisor by way of defence or set‑off if the proceedings had been brought by the promisee. (4) The promisor also has available to the promisor — ( a ) by way of defence or set‑off any matter; and ( b ) by way of counterclaim any matter not arising from the contract, that would have been available to the promisor by way of defence or set‑off or by way of counterclaim against the third party (as the case may be) if the third party had been a party to the contract. (5) Subsections (2) and (4) are subject to any express term of the contract as to the matters that are not to be available to the promisor by way of defence, set‑off or counterclaim. (6) Where, in any proceedings brought against a third party, the third party seeks to enforce a term of a contract (including, in particular, a term purporting to exclude or limit liability) in reliance on section 2, the third party may not do so if the third party could not have done so (whether by reason of any particular circumstances relating to the third party or otherwise) had the third party been a party to the contract."
