      "content": "3. —(1) For the purposes of this Act, insurance business is divided into 2 classes — ( a ) life business, which means all insurance business concerned with life policies, long-term accident and health policies, or both; and ( b ) general business, that is to say, all insurance business which is not life business, including the effecting and carrying out by any person, not being a person licensed, approved, designated or otherwise regulated under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act 1970, Banking Act 1970, Finance Companies Act 1967 or Securities and Futures Act 2001; of contracts for fidelity bonds, performance bonds, administration bonds, bail bonds or customs bonds or similar contracts of guarantee, being contracts effected by way of business (and not merely incidental to some other business carried on by the person effecting them) in return for the payment of one or more premiums. [23/2003; 11/2013] (2) For the purposes of this Act, the reinsurance of liabilities under insurance policies by a licensed insurer or an authorised reinsurer is treated as insurance business of the class and type to which the nature of the risk assumed or liabilities undertaken by that licensed insurer or authorised reinsurer relates. [11/2013] (3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), if the Authority is satisfied that any part of an insurer’s business which belongs to a particular class or type of insurance business ought in the insurer’s case to be treated as belonging to another class or type, the Authority may direct that it is to be so treated for the purposes of this Act. (4) For the purposes of this Act, references to carrying on insurance business include the carrying it on through an agent. [11/2013] (5) For the purposes of this Act and subject to subsection (6), “Singapore insurer” means a person who is or has been carrying on insurance business in Singapore. [11/2013] (6) A person is not to be treated as carrying on insurance business, or any class of insurance business, in Singapore if, apart from the collection or receipt of premiums in Singapore, the person — ( a ) carries out all activities in relation to the person’s reinsurance business outside Singapore; and ( b ) does not have any commercial or physical presence in Singapore for the purpose of carrying on such reinsurance business. [23/2003; 11/2013] (7) The operation, otherwise than for profit, of a scheme or arrangement relating to service in particular offices or employments, and having for its object or one of its objects to make provision in respect of persons serving therein against future retirement or partial retirement, or against future termination of service through death or disability, or against similar matters, is not to be treated for the purposes of this Act as carrying on the business of insurance. (8) For the purposes of this Act, no society registered under the Societies Act 1966 or organisation registered under the Mutual Benefit Organisations Act 1960 is deemed to be an insurer, and no agent for such a society or organisation is as such deemed to be an insurance agent; nor do references in this Act to a policy or contract of insurance apply to any policy or contract whereby an insurance is effected with such a society or organisation. (9) For the purposes of this Act — ( a ) any reference to the last statutory balance sheet or to the last statutory valuation is to be construed as referring to that last prepared or made and not superseded by the arrival of the date as at which another is to be prepared or made; and ( b ) any reference to there being shown in a statutory balance sheet or on a statutory valuation a surplus of assets over liabilities of an insurance fund is to be construed accordingly by reference to the form of balance sheet or valuation balance sheet as the Authority may prescribe or specify in directions, and to the rules to be followed under this Act and any such directions in preparing it. [11/2013] (10) The definitions set out in the First Schedule have effect for the construction of references in this Act to policies of insurance, policy owners and policy moneys. [2 [23/2003]"

[23/2003; 11/2013] (3) If, in the case of a direct insurer licensed to carry on life business, no part of the surplus of assets over liabilities from its non‑participating policies is allocated by the insurer by way of bonus to its participating policies, the insurer must, in addition to the funds maintained under subsections (1) and (2) and subject to such conditions or restrictions as the Authority may impose, establish and maintain, in respect of its non-investment-linked policies, separate insurance funds — ( a ) for its participating policies; and ( b ) for its non-participating policies.

[23/2003; 11/2013] (5) There must be paid into an insurance fund all receipts of the insurer properly attributable to the business to which the fund relates (including the income of the fund), and the assets comprised in the fund must be applicable only to meet such part of the insurer’s liabilities and expenses as is properly so attributable. [16/2011] (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the Authority may prescribe or specify in directions what constitutes receipts, income, liabilities or expenses of the insurer which are properly attributable to the business to which an insurance fund relates and the manner in which each item is to be determined or valued. [23/2003] (7) In the case of an insurance fund maintained by a direct insurer licensed to carry on life business which comprises wholly or partly of participating policies — ( a ) there must be a surplus account, established and maintained in such manner as the Authority may prescribe or specify in directions, as part of the insurance fund; ( b ) no part of the fund may be allocated by way of bonus to the participating policies except — (i) with the approval of the directors of the insurer, upon considering a written recommendation from the actuary appointed under section 35; and (ii) where the making of such allocation does not contravene any condition or restriction that may be prescribed or specified in directions for the purposes of this section; ( c ) no part of the fund may be allocated to the surplus account except — (i) with the approval of the directors of the insurer, upon considering a written recommendation from the actuary appointed under section 35; (ii) where the making of such allocation does not contravene the fund solvency requirement under section 17; (iii) where the making of such allocation does not contravene any condition or restriction that may be prescribed or specified in directions for the purposes of this section; and (iv) where the amount does not exceed 1 / 9 th of the amount allocated pursuant to paragraph ( b ) for a particular accounting period. [23/2003; 11/2013] (8) Despite subsection (7)( c ), an insurer may make additional allocations to the surplus account of an insurance fund which comprises wholly or partly of participating policies of an amount and in a manner as prescribed or specified in directions by the Authority. [23/2003] (9) Where the amount allocated to the surplus account in a particular accounting period pursuant to subsection (7)( c ) is less than 1 / 9 th of the amount allocated pursuant to subsection (7)( b ) for that accounting period, the insurer must not allocate the difference between the amount actually allocated and the 1 / 9 th amount allowed to the surplus account in any subsequent accounting period. [23/2003] (10) An insurer may, where there is a surplus of assets over liabilities of an insurance fund, at any time withdraw from the fund an amount not exceeding the surplus over any fund solvency requirement prescribed for that fund under section 17 if and only if — ( a ) there is no provision in any instrument or contract binding the insurer disallowing such a withdrawal; and ( b ) the insurer ascertains from the latest statement of accounts lodged with the Authority in accordance with section 94 or such other subsequent audited statement of accounts provided to the Authority that there is in fact such a surplus at the time of the withdrawal. [23/2003] (11) On the making of any withdrawal in accordance with subsection (10), the surplus of the fund is, for the purposes of this section, treated as reduced by the amount withdrawn. [23/2003] (12) Any amount withdrawn from an insurance fund under subsection (10) and, in a winding up, any part of an insurance fund remaining after meeting the liabilities and expenses to which the fund is applicable may be dealt with as if it had not formed part of the fund except that, in the case of a winding up where any other insurance fund of the insurer under this Act is in deficit, the surplus remaining after the winding up must first be applied to make good the deficit in that fund. [23/2003] (13) Any insurance fund established by an insurer for any class of insurance business must, even if the insurer at any time ceases to carry on that class of business in Singapore, continue to be maintained by the insurer so long as the insurer is required by this Act to maintain a register of policies for policies belonging to that class.

[16/2011; 11/2013] (5) The Authority must serve a copy of any report provided under subsection (3) on the liquidator. [16/2011] (6) The Authority must be a party to any proceedings under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 relating to the winding up of the affairs of an insurer licensed under this Act or an insurance broker registered under this Act, and the liquidator in such a winding up must give the Authority such information as it may from time to time require about the affairs of the insurer or insurance broker, as the case may be.

      "content": "146. —(1) A life policy insuring the life of a person which is issued by a licensed insurer is void unless — ( a ) the person effecting the insurance has an insurable interest in the life which is insured at the time the insurance is effected; ( b ) the life which is insured is that of — (i) the person effecting the insurance; (ii) his or her spouse at the time the insurance is effected; (iii) his or her child or ward under the age of 18 years at the time the insurance is effected; or (iv) any other person on whom the person effecting the insurance is, at the time the insurance is effected, wholly or partly dependant; or ( c ) the life policy is one in respect of which all of the conditions referred to in subsection (3) or (4) are satisfied. [3/2009; 11/2013] (2) Where subsection (1)( a ) applies, the policy moneys payable under the life policy must not exceed the amount of the insurable interest at the time the insurance is effected. [3/2009] (3) Section 5 of the Civil Law Act 1909 and section 151 do not apply to a life policy, and a life policy is not void, if all of the following conditions are satisfied: ( a ) the life which is insured is that of the settlor of a trust; ( b ) the person effecting the insurance is the trustee of the trust; ( c ) any beneficiary of the trust — (i) has an insurable interest in the life of the settlor at the time the insurance is effected; or (ii) is — (A) the settlor’s spouse at the time the insurance is effected; (B) the settlor’s child or ward under the age of 18 years at the time the insurance is effected; or (C) any other person on whom the settlor is, at the time the insurance is effected, wholly or partly dependant; ( d ) the settlor consents in writing to the effecting of the insurance before it is effected. [3/2009] (4) Section 5 of the Civil Law Act 1909 and section 151 do not apply to a life policy, and a life policy is not void, if all of the following conditions are satisfied: ( a ) the life which is insured is that of a beneficiary of a trust (called in this subsection the relevant beneficiary); ( b ) the person effecting the insurance is the trustee of the trust; ( c ) any beneficiary of the trust — (i) has an insurable interest in the life of the relevant beneficiary at the time the insurance is effected; or (ii) is — (A) the relevant beneficiary’s spouse at the time the insurance is effected; (B) the relevant beneficiary’s child or ward under the age of 18 years at the time the insurance is effected; or (C) any other person on whom the relevant beneficiary is, at the time the insurance is effected, wholly or partly dependant; ( d ) the relevant beneficiary consents in writing to the effecting of the insurance before it is effected. [3/2009] (5) Subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) apply to a life policy regardless of whether the proper law of the life policy is the law of Singapore. [3/2009] (6) In this section, “insuring the life of a person” means insuring the payment of money (or the equivalent) on that person’s death or on the happening of any contingency dependent on the termination or continuance of that person’s life, and includes granting an annuity to commence on that death or at a time to be determined by reference thereto or to any such contingency. (7) Insofar as in the case of any life policy the policy moneys do not consist wholly of a cash payment due on the death in question, the limit under this section on the amount to be paid must be applied by reference to the value of the right to the policy moneys immediately after the death or the happening before the death of any event on which they become payable. (8) Subsections (1)( a ) and ( b ), (2), (6) and (7) do not affect policies issued before 1 January 1967. [3/2009] (9) Subsections (1)( c ), (3), (4) and (5) do not affect policies issued before 1 March 2009. [57 [3/2009]"

[11/2013] (2) Where a life policy has been in force for 3 years or more, the policy does not lapse and must not be forfeited by reason of the non‑payment of premiums, but has effect subject to such modifications as to the period for which it is to be in force or the benefits receivable thereunder or both as may be determined in accordance with any system adopted by the insurer and applicable to the policy; and — ( a ) in the case of a policy issued as a Singapore policy after 1 January 1967 or as an offshore policy issued after 1 January 1987, the system must be approved by the Authority, and must be that adopted and applicable at the time the policy is issued, and the policy must contain a statement in a form approved by the Authority of the effect of this subsection in relation to the policy; and ( b ) in any other case, unless the system is determined by the policy, the system must be that which at the time when this section becomes applicable to the policy would apply to a like policy then issued as a Singapore policy. (3) Where a life policy has been in force for 3 years or more, the policy owner may by written notice to the insurer elect to exchange the policy for a paid‑up policy, which must be a non‑participating policy for an amount determined in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed, but with no other modification not required by this Act or some other written law. (4) A policy issued in place of an earlier policy is, for the purposes of this section (including this subsection), treated as having been in force since the earlier policy began to be in force; but this does not affect the operation in relation to a policy of subsection (2)( a ) or ( b ). (5) Subsections (1) to (3) do not apply — ( a ) to a policy securing the grant of an annuity for a term dependent upon human life; or ( b ) to a policy under which no policy moneys are necessarily payable, not being a policy which provides for the payment of policy moneys on a death after a specified period. (6) As respects policies of any prescribed description, subsections (1), (2) and (3) have effect subject to such modifications as may be prescribed. (7) The rights conferred by this section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other rights available to the policy owner under the terms of the policy or otherwise; but this section is not to be taken to confer on a policy owner any rights except against the insurer as such. (8) This section applies to policies whenever issued; and, subject to subsection (5), extends to any Singapore policy and offshore policy. [60"

[3/2009; 11/2013] (3) If, in any case referred to in subsection (2), estate duty is payable in Singapore on any death benefits referred to in that subsection, the licensed insurer may, despite section 43(2) of the Estate Duty Act 1929, make one or more payments in accordance with subsections (10) and (11) from the death benefits under all such policies issued by the licensed insurer (such payment or payments not exceeding in the aggregate the amount prescribed by the Authority for the purposes of this subsection) without the death benefits having been included in any schedule or certificate referred to in section 43(2) of that Act. [3/2009; 11/2013] (4) If, as a consequence of making any payment under subsection (3), the aggregate of all payments made under that subsection will exceed the amount prescribed by the Authority for the purposes of this subsection, the licensed insurer must, before making the firstmentioned payment, give written notice to the Commissioner of Estate Duties of such particulars as the Commissioner may require. [3/2009; 11/2013] (5) Subsection (3) applies in relation to death benefits under policies of which the deceased was not the policy owner at his or her death as it applies in relation to any death benefits referred to in subsection (2).

[3/2009; 11/2013] (10) Subject to subsection (11), where — ( a ) the policy owner of a policy referred to in subsection (2) or (3) has not made — (i) any nomination under section 132(2) or 133(2) in respect of the policy; or (ii) any will which — (A) provides for the disposition of all death benefits under the policy; and (B) specifies such particulars of the policy as may be prescribed by the Authority under section 133(7)( b )(ii); ( b ) the licensed insurer of a policy referred to in subsection (2) or (3) has not received — (i) any written notice referred to in section 134(1)( b ) of any nomination made under section 132(2) or 133(2) in respect of the policy; or (ii) any written notice referred to in subsection (9)( c ) of any will providing for the disposition of all death benefits under the policy; or ( c ) there exist, in respect of a policy referred to in subsection (2) or (3), such other circumstances as the Authority may prescribe, the licensed insurer of the policy may make a payment under subsection (2)( b ) or (3) to any proper claimant from the death benefits under the policy. [3/2009; 11/2013] (11) Where subsection (10) applies, and the licensed insurer referred to in that subsection receives 2 or more different claims for payment in accordance with that subsection — ( a ) each such claim must be paid in the same order of priority; and ( b ) the amount payable under subsection (2)( b ) or (3) (as the case may be) in respect of any such claim must be calculated as follows: where A is the amount which would have been payable in respect of that claim had it been paid in full; B is the total amount which would have been payable in respect of all such claims had they been paid in full; and C is the amount prescribed by the Authority for the purposes of subsection (2)( b ) or (3), as the case may be. [3/2009; 11/2013] (12) In this section, unless the context otherwise requires — “policy owner” includes a part owner of a policy; “proper claimant” means a person who — ( a ) claims to be entitled to payment under subsection (2)( b ) or (3) as executor of the deceased; or ( b ) claims to be entitled to payment under subsection (2)( b ) or (3) (whether for his or her own benefit or not) and is the widower, widow, parent, child, brother, sister, nephew or niece of the deceased; “relevant person” means the personal representative of the deceased or, where there is none, any proper claimant. [3/2009] (13) In deducing any relationship for the purposes of the definition of “proper claimant” in subsection (12), an illegitimate person is treated as the legitimate child of his or her actual parents. [3/2009] (14) For the purposes of this section, where any nomination has been or is deemed to be varied, any reference to a nominee under that nomination is to be construed as a reference to a nominee under that nomination as varied.
