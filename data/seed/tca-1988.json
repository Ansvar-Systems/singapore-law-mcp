(2) The relevant date mentioned in subsection (1) is — ( a ) the date on which the results of the election in the constituency are published in accordance with the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954; or ( b ) where a writ of election is issued in respect of more than one such constituency, the latest date among the dates on which the results of the election in each such constituency are published in accordance with that Act.

(4) Where the boundaries of any constituency within a Town are altered under the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 and there is an election in any or every new constituency so formed — ( a ) any order made under section 3 declaring the constituency to be or to form part of the Town, and any order made under section 4 establishing a Town Council for that Town, is not invalidated on account of such alteration in the boundaries but remains valid and of full force until expressly revoked or amended; and ( b ) except as otherwise provided in subsections (5), (6) and (7), the Town Council must transfer 80% of its surpluses to the prescribed sinking funds of the Town Council. (5) Where all or any of the constituencies within a Town have been amalgamated under the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 to form a new constituency the total area of which, either alone or together with the other constituencies, remains identical to that of the Town, and there is an election in the new constituency, the Town Council for that Town must, subject to subsection (7), transfer its surpluses in the following manner: ( a ) if the Member or Members elected for the new constituency and the previous Members of the amalgamated former constituencies stood in elections for the same political party — 80% of its surpluses relating to such area of the Town comprised in that new constituency must be transferred to the prescribed sinking funds of the Town Council relating to that area; or ( b ) if the Member or Members elected for the new constituency and the previous Members of the amalgamated former constituencies stood in elections for different political parties — all its surpluses relating to such area of the Town comprised in that new constituency must be transferred to the prescribed sinking funds of the Town Council relating to that area. (6) Where all or any of the constituencies within a Town have been subdivided under the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 to form new constituencies the total area of which, whether on their own or together with other constituencies, remains identical to that of the Town, and there is an election in any of the new constituencies, the Town Council must, subject to subsection (7), transfer its surpluses in the following manner: ( a ) if the Member or Members elected for any such new constituency and the previous Member or Members of the subdivided former constituency stood in elections for the same political party — 80% of its surpluses relating to such area of the Town comprised in that new constituency must be transferred to the prescribed sinking funds of the Town Council relating to that area; ( b ) if the Member or Members elected for any such new constituency and the previous Member or Members of the subdivided former constituency stood in elections for different political parties — all its surpluses relating to such area of the Town comprised in that new constituency must be transferred to the prescribed sinking funds of the Town Council relating to that area. (7) Nothing in this section requires a Town Council for a Town to transfer to any of its sinking funds any part of its surpluses which — ( a ) are fixed assets owned by the Town Council on the day immediately before a writ of election is issued in respect of any constituency within the Town; or ( b ) are necessary to meet any capital commitments made or entered into by that Town Council on or before that same day. (8) For the purposes of this section — ( a ) an independent candidate is regarded as standing in an election for a political party comprising himself or herself; and ( b ) independent candidates standing for election as a group are regarded as standing in an election for a political party comprising members of that group.

(2) Charges levied by a Town Council under subsection (1) are payable, subject to this section, by the owner or tenant of every such flat or stall, as the case may be. (3) In respect of any charges levied under subsection (1) and the interest thereon, the owner of a flat is liable, jointly and severally with any person who was liable to pay the charges and interest when the charges become due and payable, to pay the charges and interest to the Town Council. (4) A person who has ceased to be the owner of the flat is only liable to pay the charges which were unpaid at the time the person ceased to be the owner and the interest accruing on the unpaid charges until such time as they are paid. (5) Any charges levied under subsection (1) — ( a ) become due and payable to a Town Council in accordance with the by-laws of the Town Council; and ( b ) if not paid within the month when the charges become due and payable to a Town Council, bear interest at such rate as the Town Council thinks fit and such interest accrues from the expiry of the month after the date when the charges become due and payable unless the Town Council determines either generally or in a particular case that any unpaid charges bear no interest, and any interest so paid forms part of the fund to which the charges belong. (6) Where any charges and interest thereon levied under this section are not paid within the month when they become due and payable, a Town Council may serve a written demand on an owner or a tenant of the flat or stall in respect of which the charges are levied. (7) Any owner or tenant of a flat or stall who fails to pay any charges or interest due and owing to a Town Council within 14 days from the date the written demand mentioned in subsection (6) is served on the owner or tenant shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000. (8) The court before which the conviction is had may, in addition to such fine, order the owner or tenant to pay to the Town Council the amount of any charges together with any interest due thereon or any interest certified by the Town Council to be due from the owner or tenant at the date of the owner’s or tenant’s conviction and such amount may be recovered according to the law for the time being in force for the recovery of fines.

(10) Without limiting any particular power of a Town Council, any charges levied by the Town Council under this section may be — ( a ) varied by the Town Council from time to time; or ( b ) remitted or refunded in whole or in part. (11) A Town Council may under this section levy different rates of charges in respect of flats in any residential or commercial property or of stalls in any market or food centre of the Board in accordance with such criteria as it may determine.

(13) Any written demand required by this section to be served on the owner or tenant of a flat or stall is deemed to be sufficiently served — ( a ) if the demand is delivered to the owner or tenant or is delivered at the flat or stall to some adult member or employee of his or her family; ( b ) if it is sent to the owner or tenant by registered post to his or her flat or his or her usual or last known place of abode or business; or ( c ) if it is affixed to some conspicuous part of his or her flat.
