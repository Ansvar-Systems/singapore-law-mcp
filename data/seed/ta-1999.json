(6) Before the owner or occupier of any land fells, lops or clears any tree or vegetation adjacent to a public telecommunication licensee’s installation or plant, the owner or occupier must give the licensee 14 days’ notice in writing of the intention to do so and must take all such reasonable precautions as the licensee may require for the protection of such installation or plant.

[19/2011] (2) In deciding whether it is in the public interest to issue the separation order, the Minister must have regard to whether the issue of the separation order is necessary or desirable for one or more of the following purposes: ( a ) to promote and maintain fair and efficient market conduct and effective competition between persons engaged in commercial activities connected with telecommunication systems and services in Singapore; ( b ) to promote the efficiency and international competitiveness of the telecommunication industry in Singapore; ( c ) to eliminate or reduce barriers to competition arising from the control of any telecommunication system, or the possession of significant market power, by the relevant telecommunication licensee; ( d ) to promote transparency, non-discrimination and equivalence of supply in relation to the provision of telecommunication services in Singapore.

[19/2011] (9) For the purposes of subsection (8), the Minister must, within 6 months after the making of the separation order, by notification in the Gazette , establish a scheme for determining the amount of any compensation payable to the relevant telecommunication licensee.

[19/2011] (16) The relevant telecommunication licensee and any person affected by the separation order must comply with the separation order. [19/2011] (17) Any person who contravenes subsection (16) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction — ( a ) in the case of an individual, to a fine not exceeding $125,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $12,500 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction; ( b ) in the case of an entity which is granted a licence under section 5, to a fine not exceeding the higher of the following amounts: (i) 10% of the annual turnover of that part of its business in respect of which it is granted the licence, as ascertained from its latest audited accounts; or (ii) $1 million, and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $100,000 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction; or ( c ) in any other case, to a fine not exceeding $1 million and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $100,000 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction. [19/2011] (18) Subsections (4), (5)( a ), (6), (7) and (8) of section 37 apply with the necessary modifications to this section as they apply to Part 5A. [19/2011] (19) In this section — “30% controller”, in relation to a telecommunication licensee, means a person who, alone or together with the person’s associates — ( a ) holds 30% or more of the total number of voting shares in the telecommunication licensee; or ( b ) is in a position to control 30% or more of the voting power in the telecommunication licensee; “broadcasting licensee” has the meaning given by section 2(1) of the Broadcasting Act 1994, but does not include a class licensee as defined in section 2(1) of that Act; “business” includes any business affairs, property, right, obligation or liability; “effective control”, in relation to a telecommunication licensee or an independent e"
