(2) Subject to subsection (3), where as a result of any occurrence, there arises a grave and imminent threat of damage being caused outside a ship by the contamination that might result if there were a discharge or an escape of bunker oil from the ship, the owner of the ship shall, except as otherwise provided by this Part, be liable — ( a ) for the cost of any measures reasonably taken to prevent or minimise any such damage in the territory of Singapore; and ( b ) for any damage caused outside the ship in the territory of Singapore by any measures so taken, and in this Act, any such threat is called a relevant threat of contamination.

(4) Where a person incurs a liability under subsection (1) or (2), the person shall also be liable for any damage or cost for which the person would be liable under subsection (1) or (2) if the references in that subsection to the territory of Singapore included the territory of any other Bunker Convention country. (5) Where — ( a ) as a result of any occurrence, a liability is incurred under this section by the owner of each of 2 or more ships; but ( b ) the damage or cost of which each of the owners would be liable cannot reasonably be separated from that for which the other or others would be liable, each of the owners shall be liable, jointly with the other or others, for the whole of the damage or cost for which the owners together would be liable under this section. (6) For the purposes of this section, references to the owner of a ship are references to the owner at the time of the occurrence or first of the occurrences, resulting in the discharge or escape of bunker oil from the ship or giving rise to the relevant threat of contamination, as the case may be. (7) The Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 applies in relation to any damage or cost for which a person is liable under this section, but which is not due to the person’s fault, as if it were due to the person’s fault."

(2) If on such an application the Court finds that the applicant has incurred such a liability and is entitled to limit it, the Court, after determining the limit of liability and directing payment into Court or to the Authority of the amount of that limit, is to — ( a ) determine the amounts that would, apart from the limit, be due in respect of the liability to the several persons making claims in the proceedings; and ( b ) direct the distribution of the amount paid into Court or to the Authority (or, as the case may be, so much of it as does not exceed the liability) among those persons in proportion to their claims, subject to the provisions of this section. (3) A payment into Court or to the Authority of the amount of a limit determined under this section must be made in Singapore dollars, and — ( a ) for the purpose of converting such an amount from special drawing rights into Singapore dollars, one special drawing right is treated as equal to such a sum in Singapore dollars as the International Monetary Fund has fixed as being the equivalent of one special drawing right for — (i) the day on which the determination is made; or (ii) if no sum has been so fixed for that day, the last day before that day for which a sum has been so fixed; ( b ) a certificate given by or on behalf of the Minister for Finance stating — (i) that a particular sum in Singapore dollars had been so fixed for the day on which the determination was made; or (ii) that no sum had been so fixed for that day and that a particular sum in Singapore dollars had been so fixed for a day which was the last day for which a sum had been so fixed before the day on which the determination was made, is conclusive evidence of those matters for the purposes of this Part; and ( c ) a document purporting to be such a certificate shall, in any proceedings, be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, is deemed to be such a certificate. (4) No claim may be admitted in proceedings under this section unless it is made within such time as the Court may direct or such further time as the Court may allow. (5) Where any sum has been paid in or towards satisfaction of any claim in respect of the damage or cost to which the liability extends — ( a ) by the owner or the person referred to in section 14 as “the insurer”; or ( b ) by a person who has or is alleged to have incurred a liability, otherwise than under section 3, for the damage or cost and who is entitled to limit the person’s liability in connection with the ship by virtue of section 136 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the person who paid the sum shall, to the extent of that sum, be in the same position with respect to any distribution made in proceedings under this section as the person to whom it was paid would have been. (6) Where the person who incurred the liability has voluntarily made any reasonable sacrifice or taken any other reasonable measures to prevent or reduce damage to which the liability extends or might have extended, the person shall be in the same position with respect to any distribution made in proceedings under this section as if the person had a claim in respect of the liability equal to the cost of the sacrifice or other measures. (7) The Court may, if it thinks fit, postpone the distribution of such part of the amount to be distributed as it considers appropriate having regard to any claims that may later be established before a court of any country outside Singapore. (8) The proportions in which any amount is distributed in accordance with subsection (2)( b ) are not affected by any lien or other right in respect of any ship or other property."

(3) The certificate shall be — ( a ) if the ship is a Singapore ship — a certificate issued by the Director; ( b ) if the ship is registered in a Bunker Convention country other than Singapore — a certificate issued by or under the authority of the government of that other Bunker Convention country; and ( c ) if the ship is registered in a country which is not a Bunker Convention country — a certificate issued by the Director or by or under the authority of the government of any Bunker Convention country other than Singapore. (4) The Authority may, with the approval of the Minister, by regulations provide that certificates in respect of ships registered in any country or any specified country which is not a Bunker Convention country are, in such circumstances as may be specified in the regulations, recognised for the purposes of subsection (3)( c ) if the certificates are issued by or under the authority of the government of the country designated in the regulations in that behalf; and the country that may be so designated may be either or both of the following: ( a ) the country in which the ship is registered; ( b ) any country specified in the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

(2) In any proceedings brought against the insurer by virtue of this section, it is a defence (in addition to any defence affecting the owner’s liability) to prove that the discharge or escape or the relevant threat of contamination (as the case may be) was due to the wilful misconduct of the owner.
