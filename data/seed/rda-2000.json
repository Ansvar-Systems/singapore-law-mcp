[29/2017] [Act 7 of 2022 wef 26/05/2022] (2) Where any person claims a right of priority in accordance with subsection (1) in respect of an application for the registration of a design — ( a ) the person has priority from (and including) the date on which the first Convention application was filed; and ( b ) the application is to be treated, for the purposes of determining whether that or any other design is new, as filed on the date on which the first Convention application was filed. (3) Subsection (2) is not to be construed as excluding the power to give directions under section 5(3) in relation to the application for the registration of a design. (4) Despite any of the provisions of this Act, where a right of priority is claimed in respect of an application for the registration of a design, the application must not be refused, and the registration of the design under this Act must not be revoked, by reason only of the fact that the first Convention application has been published during the period between — ( a ) the date the first Convention application was filed; and ( b ) the date the application under this Act was filed. (5) Any filing of an application for the registration of a design which in a Convention country is equivalent to a regular national filing, under its domestic legislation or an international agreement, is to be treated as giving rise to the right of priority. (6) In subsection (5), “regular national filing” means a filing which is adequate to establish the date on which the application was filed in the Convention country, whatever may be the outcome of the application. (7) Where a subsequent application for registration of a design concerning the same subject as an earlier application is filed, whether in the same or a different Convention country, and these are the first 2 applications concerning that subject to be filed in any Convention country, the subsequent application is to be considered the first Convention application if, at the date the subsequent application is filed — ( a ) the earlier application has been withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without having been laid open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding; and ( b ) the earlier application has not yet served as a basis for claiming a right of priority. (8) To avoid doubt, where subsection (7) applies — ( a ) the date on which the subsequent application was filed, rather than that of the earlier application, is to be considered the starting date of the period of priority under subsection (2); and ( b ) the earlier application may not thereafter serve as a basis for claiming a right of priority. (9) The Minister may make rules as to the manner of claiming priority under this section. (10) A right to priority arising under this section may be assigned or otherwise transmitted, either with the application or independently, and the reference in subsection (1) to the applicant’s “successor in title” is to be construed accordingly."
