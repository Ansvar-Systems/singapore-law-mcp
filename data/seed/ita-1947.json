(2) In subsection (1)( b ), “gains or profits from any employment” means — ( a ) any wages, salary, leave pay, fee, commission, bonus, gratuity, perquisite or allowance (other than a subsistence, travelling, conveyance or entertainment allowance which is proved to the Comptroller’s satisfaction to have been expended for purposes other than those in respect of which no deduction is allowed under section 15) paid or granted in respect of the employment whether in money or otherwise; ( b ) the value of any food, clothing or lodging provided or paid for by the employer; ( c ) for the year of assessment 2014 and any preceding year of assessment, the annual value of any place of residence provided by the employer and for the purposes of this paragraph — (i) if the remuneration received by a director of a company is less than the annual value of the premises, the full annual value is deemed to be gains or profits of the employment; (ii) except as provided in sub‑paragraph (i), if the annual value of the premises exceeds 10% of the gains or profits from the employment mentioned in paragraphs ( a ) and ( b ) less the rent (if any) paid by the employee for the use of the premises, the excess is disregarded; (iii) where the premises are shared, “place of residence” means the part of the premises occupied by the person chargeable; ( ca ) for any year of assessment between the years of assessment 2015 and 2019 (both years inclusive), the annual value of any place of residence provided by the employer (or the part thereof occupied by the employee if the premises are shared with another) less the rent (if any) paid by the employee for the use of the premises; ( cb ) for the year of assessment 2020 and subsequent years of assessment, either — (i) the rent paid by the employer for any place of residence provided by the employer (or the part of such place of residence occupied by the employee if the premises are shared with another), including for any furniture and fittings in that place or part; or (ii) if no such rent is paid, the annual value of such place or part, less any rent paid by the employee for the place or part; ( d ) any sum standing to the account of any individual in any pension or provident fund or society which the individual is entitled to withdraw upon retirement or which is withdrawn therefrom.

[45/2018] (2AC) However (and to avoid doubt), subsection (2AB) does not apply in a case where the Comptroller exercises his or her power under subsection (2AA). [45/2018] (2B) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister may, for the purposes of such year of assessment as he or she may specify, by regulations prescribe the value of any furniture and fittings in any place of residence.

(6A) To avoid doubt, section 10(5) in force immediately before 10 December 2002 continues to apply to any gains or profits directly or indirectly derived by the exercise, assignment or release of any right or benefit to acquire shares (including stocks) in a company granted to a person before 1 January 2003, whether in his or her name or in the name of his or her nominee or agent, where the right or benefit was obtained by that person by reason of any office or employment held by him or her. (7) Despite subsection (6), where — ( a ) the right or benefit to acquire shares in a company is granted on or after 1 January 2003 to an individual while he or she is exercising an employment in Singapore; and ( b ) immediately before he or she ceases that employment — (i) the individual is neither a citizen of Singapore nor a Singapore permanent resident, or being a Singapore permanent resident is leaving Singapore permanently; and (ii) the right or benefit is not exercised, assigned, released or acquired by him or her, or the restriction on the sale of the shares has not ceased to apply, any gains or profits from the right or benefit are — ( c ) deemed to be income derived by the individual one month before the date of cessation of employment or the date the right or benefit is granted, whichever is the later; and ( d ) computed based on the price of the shares in the open market on that date, less the amount paid for the shares. (7AA) Despite subsection (7), if — ( a ) within 5 years after the year in which the later of the dates mentioned in subsection (7)( c ) falls, either the individual ( X ) exercises, assigns, releases or acquires the right or benefit or, if the right or benefit is subject to any restriction on the sale of the shares so acquired, the restriction ceases to apply; ( b ) any gains or profits of X computed in accordance with subsection (6) would have been lower than the amount computed in accordance with subsection (7); and ( c ) X makes an application under subsection (7AC), then X ’s gains or profits from the right or benefit are computed in accordance with subsection (6)( a ) to ( d ) (whichever is applicable) and treated as income derived on the later of the dates mentioned in subsection (7)( c ), and is chargeable to tax under subsection (1)( b ). [Act 25 of 2025 wef 08/12/2025] (7AB) Subsection (7) does not apply if — ( a ) within 5 years after the year in which the later of the dates mentioned in subsection (7)( c ) falls, the right or b"

(7A) Subsection (7) also has effect for the purpose of determining, under subsections (6)( f ) and ( g ) and (6A), the beneficial ownership of a person in the equity interests of a trust fund for which a prescribed person is a trustee, with the following modifications: ( a ) the reference in subsection (7)( b ) to the equity interests of another person (when applied to that trust fund) is to be read as the equity interests in that fund; ( b ) the reference in the definition of B under subsection (7) to the value of equity interests of the second level entity beneficially owned by the first level entity (when applied to that trust fund) is to be read as the value of the part of the trust fund beneficially owned by the first level entity; ( c ) the reference in the definition of B under subsection (7) to the total value of all equity interests of the second level entity (when applied to that trust fund) is to be read as the total value of the trust fund.

      "content": "13S. —(1) Any law practice intending to provide legal services in connection with any international arbitration may, from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2017 (both dates inclusive), apply to the Minister, or such person as the Minister may appoint, for approval as an approved law practice. (2) Where the Minister, or such person as the Minister may appoint, considers it expedient in the public interest to do so, the Minister or appointed person may approve the application and issue a letter to the law practice subject to such conditions as the Minister or appointed person thinks fit. (2A) No approval under this section may be granted to any law practice which is approved on or after 1 April 2010 as a development and expansion company under Part 4 of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967 in respect of international services that qualify for zero‑rating under section 21(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1993, and such approval remains in force. (3) Every letter issued under subsection (2) must specify a date as the commencement day from which the approved law practice is entitled to tax relief under this section. (4) The tax relief period of an approved law practice commences on its commencement day and continues for such period, not exceeding 5 years, as is specified in the letter issued to it under subsection (2). (5) The amount of the income of an approved law practice which will qualify for the relief for any year of assessment is the excess of the total amount of the qualifying income of the approved law practice for the basis period for that year of assessment over its base income. (6) Where an approved law practice has satisfied the conditions specified in the letter issued to it under subsection (2), one‑half of the amount of the income of the approved law practice for any year of assessment for a basis period that falls within the tax relief period which qualifies for the relief as ascertained under subsection (5) does not form part of the statutory income of the approved law practice for that year of assessment and is exempt from tax. (6A) For the purpose of satisfying the Comptroller that its income qualifies for relief under this section, the approved law practice must provide, not later than 5 years after the end of its tax relief period, evidence of the place of hearing or intended place of hearing (as the case may be) of the international arbitration. (7) Where an approved law practice is a law corporation, the exemption under section 43(6) or (6C) (as the case may be) does not apply to the balance of the qualifying income exceeding the base income of the approved law practice that is not exempt under subsection (6). [45/2018] (8) The base income mentioned in subsection (5) is — ( a ) where an approved law practice had in the period of 3 years immediately preceding the commencement day provided legal services in connection with any qualifying international arbitration — (i) the amount ascertained by dividing the total income derived from providing those legal services in the period by the actual number of years in the period in which those legal services were provided; or (ii) if the amount ascertained under sub‑paragraph (i) is less than zero, deemed to be zero; or ( b ) such amount as the Minister may specify. (9) The Comptroller must determine the manner and extent to which allowances under section 19, 19A, 20, 21, 22 or 23 and any expenses and losses allowable under this Act which are attributable to the qualifying income of an approved law practice are to be deducted. (10) In determining the qualifying income of an approved law practice for the basis period for any year of assessment, there are to be deducted from the income — ( a ) expenses allowable under this Act for that year of assessment which are attributable to that income; and ( b ) any allowances for that year of assessment under section 19, 19A, 20, 21 or 22 attributable to that income even if no claim for those allowances has been made. (11) The Comptroller may require an auditor to certify the income derived by an approved law practice from legal services in connection with any qualifying international arbitration and any direct costs and expenses incurred therefor. (12) Where an approved law practice has in any year of assessment during the tax relief period incurred any loss from providing legal services in connection with any qualifying international arbitration or any allowances attributable to the qualifying income remaining unabsorbed, 50% of the loss or allowances, in each case, is to be deducted as provided for in section 23 or 37 (as the case may be) and the balance is disregarded.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) — ( a ) where 2 basis periods overlap, the period common to both is deemed to fall in the first basis period only; ( b ) where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for a year of assessment and the commencement of a basis period for the next succeeding year of assessment, then, unless the second‑mentioned year of assessment is the year of the permanent discontinuance of the trade, the interval is deemed to be part of the second basis period; and ( c ) where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for the year of assessment preceding that in which the trade is permanently discontinued and the commencement of the basis period for the year in which it is permanently discontinued, the interval is deemed to form part of the first basis period. (3) Any capital expenditure incurred for the purposes of a trade by a person about to carry on that trade is treated for the purposes of subsection (1) as if it had been incurred by that person on the first day on which that person does carry on that trade. (4) Where any person is, at the end of the basis period for any year of assessment, entitled to an interest in a building or structure which is an industrial building or structure and where that interest is the relevant interest in relation to the capital expenditure incurred before 1 January 2006 on the construction of that building or structure, an allowance, to be known as an “annual allowance”, equal to 3% of the total capital expenditure incurred by that person on the construction of that building or structure is to be made to that person for that year of assessment. (5) Where at any time in or after the basis period for the first year of assessment under this Act and before 1 January 2006, the interest in a building or structure which is the relevant interest in relation to any capital expenditure incurred before that date on the construction of that building or structure is sold while the building or structure is an industrial building or structure or after it has ceased to be one, the annual allowance, in the years of assessment the basis periods for which end after the time of that sale, is to be computed by reference to the residue of that expenditure immediately after the sale and is — ( a ) the fraction of that residue the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of years of assessment comprised in the period which begins with the first year of assessment for which the buyer is entitled to an annual allowance or would be so entitled if the building or structure had at all material times continued to be an industrial building or structure, and ends with the fiftieth year after that in which the building or structure was first used; or ( b ) 3% of that residue, whichever is the greater, and so on for any subsequent sales. (6) In the case referred to in subsection (4), no annual allowance may be made to any person for any year of assessment after the end of the fiftieth year after that in which the building or structure was first used. (6A) Where any person is, at the end of the basis period for any year of assessment, entitled to an interest in a building or structure which is an industrial building or structure, and that interest is the relevant interest in relation to — ( a ) any capital expenditure incurred by the person on or after 1 January 2006 on the construction of that building or structure; or ( b ) a sale or purchase agreement entered into for that building or structure on or after that date, whether or not the building or structure was previously used as an industrial building or structure, an annual allowance determined under subsection (6B) is to be made to the person for that year of assessment. (6B) The annual allowance under subsection (6A) is equal to — ( a ) in the case referred to in subsection (6A)( a ), 3% of the total capital expenditure incurred by the person on the construction of the building or structure; or ( b ) in the case referred to in subsection (6A)( b ), 3% of the capital expenditure incurred by the person on the purchase of the building or structure. (7) For the purposes of application to any industrial building or structure occupied for the purposes of a trade in intensive poultry production and approved by the Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint under section 18(1), the reference to 3% in subsections (4), (5) and (6B) and in sections 17(3)( a ) and 18(9) is a reference to 5%. (8) For the purposes of application to any industrial building or structure occupied for the purposes of a hotel on the island of Sentosa and approved by the Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint under section 18(1) — ( a ) the reference to 25% in subsection (1) is a reference to 20%; ( b ) the reference to 3% in subsections (4), (5) and (6B) and in sections 17(3)( a ) and 18(9) is a reference to 2%; and ( c ) the reference to capital expenditure in subsections (1) and (4) does not include any capital expenditure incurred before 1 January 1982. (9) For the purposes of application to any industrial building or structure used for the purposes of a project for the promotion of the tourist industry (other than a hotel) in Singapore and approved by the Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint under section 18(1)( i ) — ( a ) the reference to 25% in subsection (1) is a reference to 20%; ( b ) the reference to 3% in subsections (4), (5) and (6B) and in sections 17(3)( a ) and 18(9) is a reference to 2%; and ( c ) the reference to capital expenditure in subsections (1), (3) and (4) does not include any capital expenditure incurred before 1 January 1986. (10) Despite anything in this section and section 17, where a person carrying out a project for the promotion of the tourist industry approved by the Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint under section 18(1)( i ) fails to comply with any condition imposed by the Minister, the Minister may revoke the approval and thereupon the Comptroller may at any time within 6 years (if the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the approval is revoked is 2007 or a preceding year of assessment) or 4 years (if the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the approval is revoked is 2008 or a subsequent year of assessment) from the date of the revocation make such assessment or additional assessment upon the person as may appear necessary in order to recover any tax which ought to have been paid by that person if any allowances under those sections had not been made to that person. (11) Despite anything in this section, the amount of an annual allowance made to a person for any year of assessment in respect of any expenditure must not in any case exceed what, apart from the writing off falling to be made by reason of the making of that allowance, would be the residue of that expenditure at the end of the person’s basis period for that year of assessment. (12) For the purposes of subsection (1), where a person has incurred capital expenditure before 1 January 2006 on the purchase of an industrial building or structure (including the purchase of a leasehold interest therein of not less than 25 years) which has not previously been used by any person, the person is deemed to have incurred expenditure on the construction of that industrial building or structure equal to the cost of construction of that industrial building or structure or to the net price paid by the person for that industrial building or structure or the interest therein, whichever is less, if — ( a ) the person claiming the initial allowance by virtue of this subsection purchased the industrial building or structure or acquired the leasehold interest therein from the person who constructed that building or structure; and ( b ) no initial allowance has been granted under subsection (1) in respect of that industrial building or structure to the person who constructed that building or structure. (13) For the purposes of subsection (1), where a person has incurred capital expenditure on or after 1 January 2006 on the purchase of an industrial building or structure which has not previously been used by any person, the person is deemed to have incurred expenditure on the construction of that industrial building or structure equal to the capital expenditure incurred by the person on the purchase of that industrial building or structure if — ( a ) the person claiming the initial allowance by virtue of this subsection purchased the industrial building or structure from the person who constructed that building or structure; and ( b ) no initial allowance has been granted under subsection (1) in respect of that industrial building or structure to the person who constructed that building or structure. (14) Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the trade, for which purpose the industrial building is used, produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, the allowances for that year of assessment must be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances. (15) Subject to section 18B, this section does not apply to any capital expenditure incurred on or after 23 February 2010 on the construction or purchase of an industrial building or structure. (16) Subject to subsection (18) and section 18B, no annual allowance may be made under subsections (4), (5) and (6A) to a person who incurs capital expenditure on or before 22 February 2010 on the construction or purchase of a building or structure which is not an industrial building or structure on 22 February 2010 but is an industrial building or structure on or after 23 February 2010. (17) Section 18(2) and (3) applies for the purpose of determining under subsection (16) whether a building or structure is an industrial building or structure on 22 February 2010. (18) Despite subsection (16), annual allowances under subsection (6A)( a ) are to be made to a person who incurs capital expenditure on or before 22 February 2010 on a building or structure which is still under construction on 22 February 2010 and which is to be an industrial building or structure upon completion of that construction, if the person — ( a ) on or before 22 February 2010 — (i) has been granted the option to purchase the land or has entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed; (ii) has entered into a lease agreement to lease the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed; or (iii) has submitted an application to the Government or any statutory board — (A) to bid for the purchase therefrom of the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed; or (B) to lease therefrom the land on which the industrial building or structure is to be constructed; and ( b ) on or before 31 December 2010, has made an application for planning permission or conservation permission to the competent authority in accordance with the Planning Act 1998 for the development of the land comprising the construction work."

(1A) The events referred to in subsection (1) are — ( a ) the relevant interest in the building or structure is sold; ( b ) that interest, being a leasehold interest, comes to an end otherwise than on the person entitled thereto acquiring the interest which is reversionary thereon; ( c ) the building or structure is demolished or destroyed or, without being demolished or destroyed, ceases altogether to be used. (2) In the case referred to in subsection (1)( a ), no balancing allowance or balancing charge may be made to or on any person for any year of assessment by reason of any event occurring after the end of the fiftieth year after that in which the building or structure was first used. (3) No balancing allowance may be made to any person — ( a ) on the sale of the relevant interest in the building or structure unless the person proves to the Comptroller’s satisfaction that the value of the building or structure to the person is less than — (i) in the case referred to in subsection (1)( a ), the amount of the capital expenditure incurred on the construction of the building or structure reduced by the amount of any initial and annual allowances made (including an amount of 3% of the capital expenditure for each year in which no initial or annual allowance was made); or (ii) in the case referred to in subsection (1)( b ), the amount of the capital expenditure incurred by the person on the construction or purchase of the building or structure (as the case may be) reduced by the amount of any initial and annual allowances made (including an amount of 3% of the capital expenditure for each year in which no initial or annual allowance was made); or ( b ) where the relevant interest in the building or structure is not sold but the building or structure is or would be redeveloped for any use other than as an industrial building or structure. (4) Where there are no sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys, or where the residue of the expenditure immediately before the event exceeds those moneys, a balancing allowance is to be made and the amount thereof is the amount of the residue or (as the case may be) of the excess thereof over the moneys. (5) If the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys exceed the residue (if any) of the expenditure immediately before the event, a balancing charge is to be made and the amount on which it is made is an amount equal to the excess or, where the residue is nil, to the moneys. (6) Despite anything in subsection (5) but subject to subsection (7), the amount on which a balancing charge is made on a person must not in any case exceed the aggregate of the following amounts: ( a ) the amount of the initial allowance (if any) made to the person in respect of the expenditure in question; ( b ) the amount of the annual allowances (if any) made to the person in respect of the expenditure in question. (7) Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the trade, for which purpose the industrial building is used, produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, and any balancing allowance or balancing charge arises to be made — ( a ) the balancing allowance must be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances; and ( b ) such proportion of the balancing charge is exempt from tax as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances. (8) Where allowances have been made under both sections 16 and 18C in respect of any industrial building or structure, then, for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys in respect of that building or structure is such amount of those moneys as the Comptroller determines to be reasonable in the circumstances. (9) Where the relevant interest in a building or structure in respect of which allowances have been made under section 16 is transferred at less than the open‑market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing charge under subsection (5), the relevant interest in the building or structure is treated as if it had been sold for an amount equal to the open‑market price of the building or structure as at the date of transfer."

(2) A building or structure is not deemed, by reason only of its falling or having fallen into temporary disuse, to have thereby ceased altogether to be used for one of the purposes specified in subsection (1) if, immediately prior to falling into such temporary disuse, it was in use for such a purpose and if, during the period of such temporary disuse, it is constantly maintained in readiness to be brought back into use for such a purpose. (3) If, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (2), the building or structure at any time during disuse ceases to be ready for use for any of the purposes mentioned in that subsection, or if at any time, for any reason, the disuse of the building or structure can no longer be reasonably regarded as temporary, then and in any such case, the building or structure is deemed to have ceased, on the commencement of the period of disuse, to be used for any of the purposes specified in subsection (1).

(7A) Where the Comptroller is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to determine the capital expenditure incurred on the second‑mentioned part of the building or structure under subsection (7), the whole building or structure and every part thereof may be treated as an industrial building or structure if — ( a ) the floor area of the part of the building or structure that is not an industrial building or structure is not more than one‑tenth of the total floor area of the whole building or structure; or ( b ) the Comptroller is otherwise satisfied that it is just and proper to do so. (8) In this section and sections 16, 17 and 18B — “capital expenditure”, in relation to the purchase of a building or structure, means the net price paid for the building or structure, but does not include the cost of land as determined to the Comptroller’s satisfaction; “relevant interest” means — ( a ) in relation to any capital expenditure incurred on the construction of a building or structure, the interest in that building or structure to which the person who incurred the expenditure was entitled when the person incurred it; and ( b ) in relation to a sale and purchase agreement for a building or structure, the interest in that building or structure to which the purchaser was entitled when the purchaser entered into the agreement; “residue of expenditure” means — ( a ) in relation to any capital expenditure incurred on the construction of a building or structure before 1 January 2006, the amount of the capital expenditure incurred on such construction reduced by — (i) the amount of any initial allowance made; (ii) any annual allowance made; and (iii) any balancing allowances granted, and increased by any balancing charges made; or ( b ) in relation to any capital expenditure incurred on the construction or purchase of a building or structure on or after 1 January 2006, the amount of the capital expenditure incurred on such construction or purchase (as the case may be) reduced by — (i) the amount of any initial allowance made; and (ii) any annual allowance made.

(1A) No writing‑down allowance may be made under this section in respect of any expenditure incurred during the basis period for the year of assessment 2012 or any subsequent year of assessment. (2) The Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint may specify the maximum amount of expenditure in respect of which writing‑down allowances are to be made under subsection (1).

(5A) To avoid doubt, section 19C(6) in force immediately before 17 February 2006, or subsection (5) of this section (as the case may be), continues to apply to a person to whom writing‑down allowances have previously been made under this section in respect of a cost‑sharing agreement, and deductions are allowed under section 14C for expenditure incurred or payments made under the same agreement. (6) For the purpose of subsection (5), the amount or value of the consideration to be treated as a trading receipt must not exceed the amount of writing‑down allowance made under this section. (7) Where no writing‑down allowances have been made to any person in respect of expenditure incurred by the person by virtue of subsection (2) or in respect of any payment or contribution made by the person by virtue of subsection (3), the Minister may for the purposes of subsection (5) exempt such part of the amount or value of the consideration as the Minister thinks fit.

(2) The writing‑down period in respect of an IRU is the number of years for which the IRU is acquired commencing with the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the capital expenditure for the acquisition of the IRU is incurred. (3) For the purposes of this section, the writing‑down allowances in respect of an IRU are determined by the formula where A is the amount of capital expenditure incurred for the acquisition of the IRU; and B is the writing‑down period for the IRU. (4) Despite anything in this section, no writing‑down allowance may be granted to any person under subsection (1) in any year of assessment if the international telecommunications submarine cable system is not in use at the end of the basis period for that year of assessment by that person in the trade, business or profession carried on by the person.

(6) Where writing‑down allowances in respect of any IRU have been made to any person under this section and, before or at the end of the writing‑down period for the IRU, any of the following events occurs: ( a ) the IRU comes to an end without subsequent renewal by the person; ( b ) the person permanently ceases to carry on the relevant trade, business or profession; ( c ) the person sells, transfers or assigns all the IRU or so much of it as the person still owns; ( d ) the person sells, transfers or assigns part of the IRU and the amount or value of any consideration less any decommissioning cost (called in this section the consideration) for the sale, transfer or assignment is not less than the amount of capital expenditure remaining unallowed for the IRU, no writing‑down allowance in respect of the IRU may be made to the person for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the event occurs or for any subsequent year of assessment. (7) Where an IRU remains with any person after the date on which it permanently ceases to be used by the person for the relevant trade, business or profession, the IRU is deemed to have been sold by the person at the open‑market price on the date of permanent cessation of use. (8) Where writing‑down allowances in respect of any IRU have been made to any person under this section and, before or at the end of the writing‑down period for the IRU, any of the following events occurs: ( a ) the IRU comes to an end without subsequent renewal by the person; ( b ) the person permanently ceases to carry on the relevant trade, business or profession; ( c ) the person sells, transfers or assigns all the IRU or so much of it as the person still owns and the consideration for the sale, transfer or assignment is less than the amount of capital expenditure remaining unallowed for the IRU, there is to be made to the person for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the event occurs, a balancing allowance equal to — ( d ) in the case where the amount of capital expenditure remaining unallowed for the IRU exceeds the consideration for the sale, transfer or assignment of the IRU, the excess; or ( e ) in any other case, the amount of capital expenditure remaining unallowed for the IRU.

(10) Where writing‑down allowances in respect of any IRU have been made to any person under this section and the person sells, transfers or assigns any part of the IRU, and the consideration for the sale, transfer or assignment of the IRU is less than the amount of capital expenditure remaining unallowed for the IRU, the amount of any writing‑down allowances made in respect of the IRU for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the sale, transfer or assignment of the IRU occurs or any subsequent year of assessment is the amount determined by the formula where C is the amount of capital expenditure remaining unallowed at the time of the sale, transfer or assignment of the IRU; D is the consideration for the sale, transfer or assignment of that part of the IRU; and E is the number of complete years of the writing‑down period remaining at the beginning of the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the sale, transfer or assignment of the IRU occurs, and so on for any subsequent sale, transfer or assignment of the IRU. (11) Despite subsections (9) and (10), the total amount on which a balancing charge is made in respect of any capital expenditure incurred for the acquisition of an IRU must not exceed the total writing‑down allowances actually made for the IRU in respect of that capital expenditure, less, if a balancing charge has previously been made in respect of that capital expenditure, the amount on which that balancing charge was made. (12) Where the sale, transfer or assignment of all or part of any IRU is made at less than the open‑market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing allowance or balancing charge, the event is treated as if it had given rise to sale, transfer or assignment moneys of an amount equal to the open‑market price of the IRU. (13) Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the relevant trade, business or profession produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, the allowances for that year of assessment are to be made against each income in that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances. (14) Unless otherwise provided in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where, in the basis period for any year of assessment, the relevant trade, business or profession produces income that is exempt from tax as well as income chargeable with tax, and any balancing allowance or balancing charge arises to be made — ( a ) the balancing allowance is to be made against each income for that year of assessment in such proportion as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances; and ( b ) such proportion of the balancing charge is exempt from tax as appears reasonable to the Comptroller in the circumstances. (15) In this section — “capital expenditure” does not include legal fees, registration fees, stamp duty and other costs related to the acquisition of any IRU; “capital expenditure remaining unallowed”, in relation to any IRU, means the amount of capital expenditure incurred for the acquisition of the IRU less — ( a ) any writing‑down allowances made in respect of that capital expenditure for the years of assessment before the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which any event referred to in subsection (6), (8), (9) or (10) occurs; and ( b ) the consideration for any prior sale, transfer or assignment by the person who incurred the capital expenditure of any part of the IRU acquired by the capital expenditure; “international telecommunications submarine cable system” means an international submarine cable that is laid in the sea and includes its cable landing station and any other equipment ancillary to the submarine cable system; “open‑market price”, in relation to any IRU, means — ( a ) the price which the IRU would have fetched if sold in the open market at the time any event referred to in subsection (6), (8), (9) or (10) occurs; or ( b ) where the Comptroller is satisfied by reason of the special nature of any IRU that it is not practicable to determine the open‑market price, such other value as appears to the Comptroller to be reasonable in the circumstances. (16) For the purposes of this section, any sale, transfer or assignment of any IRU which occurs after the date on which a relevant trade, business or profession permanently ceases is deemed to have occurred immediately before the cessation."

(1A) Where the property in machinery or plant passes at less than the open‑market price, then for the purpose of determining the amount of any balancing allowance or balancing charge the event is treated as if it had given rise to sale moneys of an amount equal to the open‑market price of the machinery or plant. (2) Where machinery or plant continues to belong to that person after the date on which it permanently ceases to be used for the purposes of a trade, profession or business carried on by that person in Singapore, or (as the case may be) for the purpose of any research and development undertaken by that person directly in Singapore or by a research and development organisation on that person’s behalf in Singapore, it is deemed to have been sold on the date of permanent cessation of use at the open‑market price on that date. (2A) Where there are no sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys or where the amount of the capital expenditure of the person in question on the provision of the machinery or plant still unallowed as at the time of the event exceeds those moneys, a balancing allowance is to be made, and the amount thereof is the amount of the expenditure still unallowed as aforesaid or (as the case may be) the excess thereof over those moneys. (3) If the sale, insurance, salvage or compensation moneys exceed the amount (if any) of the said expenditure still unallowed as at the time of the event, a balancing charge is to be made, and the amount on which it is made is an amount equal to the excess or, where the said amount still unallowed is nil, to those moneys. (4) Despite anything in subsection (3), the amount on which a balancing charge is made on a person must not in any case exceed — ( a ) the aggregate of the initial allowance (if any) and the annual allowances (if any) made to the person under section 19 in respect of the expenditure in question; and ( b ) the allowances (if any) made to the person under section 19A in respect of the expenditure in question.

(6B) Section 14C(4) and (5) applies in relation to the balancing allowance to be made to a person under subsection (1)( b )(i) as it applies in relation to the deduction of the expenditure and payments referred to in section 14C(1)( aa ), ( c ) and ( f ), subject to the following modifications: ( a ) a reference to the amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to the amount of the balancing allowance; ( b ) a reference to unabsorbed losses is a reference to unabsorbed allowances; and ( c ) a reference to a specified amount of the expenditure or payments is a reference to an amount computed in accordance with the formula where A is the amount of the balancing allowance that could have been made against the income of the person under subsection (1)( b )(i) if the income had been subject to tax at the rate specified in section 43(1)( a ); B is the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)( a ); and C is — (i) in a case where the concessionary income (as defined in section 14C(5)) derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at a single concessionary rate of tax, that rate; or (ii) in a case where the concessionary income derived by the person from the trade or business carried on by the person is subject to tax at 2 or more concessionary rates of tax, the higher or highest of those rates. (6C) Despite anything in this Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967, where a balancing charge falls to be made on a person under subsection (1)( b )(i), the amount of the charge is deemed to be income of that person that is chargeable to tax at the rate of tax specified in section 43(1)( a ). (7) In this section, “open‑market price”, in relation to any machinery or plant, means the price which the machinery or plant would have fetched if sold in the open market at the time of the event in question; except that where the Comptroller is satisfied by reason of the special nature of any machinery or plant that it is not practicable to determine an open‑market price, the Comptroller may adopt such other value as appears to the Comptroller to be reasonable in the circumstances."

(4) Where, for any period, a non‑resident person does not, for any reason, produce a certificate complying with subsection (3), the profits accruing in Singapore are deemed to be a sum equal to 5% of the full sum receivable on account of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods shipped in Singapore. (5) Where a non‑resident person has been assessed under subsection (4) because a certificate had not been issued at the time of assessment, the non‑resident person is entitled, on the subsequent production of such a certificate to claim at any time within 2 years after the end of such year of assessment, or such further time as the Comptroller may consider reasonable in the circumstances, that the non‑resident person’s liability to tax for the year be determined on the basis provided by subsection (2). (6) Where the Comptroller decides that the call of a ship (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995) belonging to a particular non‑resident shipowner or charterer at a port in Singapore is casual and that further calls by that ship or others in the same ownership are improbable, this section does not apply to the profits of that ship and no tax is chargeable on them. [2/2016] (7) Despite anything in subsections (1) to (6), if in computing the profits derived by a resident in Singapore from carrying on the business of a shipowner or charterer, the tax authority of a foreign country determines such profits to be an amount which exceeds 5% of the full sum receivable on account of the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock and goods shipped in that foreign country, the Minister may if he or she thinks fit direct that, in computing the profits derived in Singapore by a non‑resident shipowner or charterer who is resident in that foreign country, the Comptroller must determine the amount of such profits in such manner as may be substantially similar to that adopted by the tax authority of that foreign country."

(10) Where — ( a ) there is a transfer of property, being intellectual property rights in respect of which writing‑down allowances have been made to an amalgamating company under section 19B, from that amalgamating company to the amalgamated company on the date of amalgamation; and ( b ) before the transfer in the case of that amalgamating company and from any time on or after the transfer in the case of that amalgamated company, the property is used in the production of income chargeable under the provisions of this Act, the following provisions, subject to subsection (18), apply: ( c ) section 19B(4) and (5) does not apply to the amalgamating company; ( d ) the writing‑down allowances under section 19B continue to be available to the amalgamated company as if no transfer had taken place; ( e ) the charge under section 19B(4) and (5) is to be made on the amalgamated company on any event occurring on or after the date of amalgamation as would have fallen to be made on the amalgamating company if the amalgamating company had continued to own the intellectual property rights and had done all such things and been allowed all such allowances as were done by or allowed to the amalgamated company. (11) Despite section 32 but subject to subsection (18), where there is a transfer of property, being trading stock to both an amalgamating company and the amalgamated company, from that amalgamating company to the amalgamated company on the date of amalgamation — ( a ) the net book value of the trading stock of the amalgamating company is deemed to be the value of the consideration given by the amalgamated company to the amalgamating company for such transfer on the date of amalgamation for the purpose of deducting the cost of trading stock to the amalgamated company as an expense in computing the gains or profits of the trade or business of the amalgamated company; and ( b ) only the amount of provision of diminution in value computed by reference to the net book value referred to in paragraph ( a ) of the trading stock (if any) may be allowed as a deduction to the amalgamated company.

(13) Any gains or profits of the trade or business of the amalgamating company referred to in subsection (12) are chargeable to tax for the year of assessment which relates to the basis period in which the date of amalgamation falls. (14) Where there is a transfer of property from an amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, being property on revenue account of the amalgamating company but not on revenue account of the amalgamated company, the consideration for the transfer by the amalgamating company is taken as the amount which it would have realised if the property had been sold in the open market on the date of amalgamation. (15) The amount of consideration referred to in subsection (14) is to be used to compute the gains or profits of the trade or business of the amalgamating company and such gains or profits are chargeable to tax for the year of assessment which relates to the basis period in which the date of amalgamation falls. (16) Where there is a transfer of property from an amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, being property not on revenue account of the amalgamating company but on revenue account of the amalgamated company, the consideration for the acquisition by the amalgamated company is taken as the amount which it would have incurred if the property had been purchased in the open market on the date of amalgamation or the actual amount paid, whichever is the lower. (17) The amount of consideration referred to in subsection (16) is to be deducted as an expense in computing the gains or profits of the trade or business of the amalgamated company. (18) Where the amalgamated company ceases to carry on the trade and business in Singapore after the date of amalgamation but instead carries on that trade and business outside Singapore — ( a ) in the case of trading stock which has been transferred at net book value under subsection (11)( a ), section 32(1)( b ) applies as if that trade and business has been discontinued or transferred on the date of cessation of the trade and business in Singapore, and any gain is chargeable to tax for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the amalgamated company ceases to carry on that trade and business in Singapore; ( b ) in the case of property, being intellectual property rights in respect of which subsection (10) applies, the charge under section 19B(4) or (5) (as the case may be) is to be made on the amalgamated company as if the property has been sold on the date of cessation of the trade and business in Singapore; and for the purpose of computing the charge under section 19B(5), the value thereof is the amount which it would have realised if the property had been sold in the open market on the date of cessation of such trade and business in Singapore. (19) Any question arising under subsections (14), (16) and (18) regarding the open market value attributable to property or trading stock (as the case may be) is to be determined by the Comptroller. Deductions for intellectual property rights (20) No deduction under section 19B is allowed to the amalgamated company for any intellectual property rights recognised in accordance with FRS 38 and FRS 103, or with SFRS(I) 1‑38 and SFRS(I) 3, as a result of the amalgamation but which were not in existence prior to the amalgamation.

      "content": "34H. —(1) This section applies where — ( a ) an approved redomiciled company has income (called in this section income A) that is chargeable to tax in one or more years of assessment beginning with the year of assessment for the basis period in which its registration date falls; and ( b ) the company’s place of incorporation levies on the company tax of a similar character to income tax (by whatever name called) on an estimate of income A (called in this section income B). [39/2017] (2) The approved redomiciled company must be allowed, in accordance with subsection (4), a tax credit against tax payable in respect of the part of income A that is derived or received in the basis period for each year of assessment specified by the Minister to the company at the time of its approval (called in this section a specified year of assessment). [39/2017] (3) The total amount of tax credits to be allowed to the approved redomiciled company for all of its specified years of assessment is an amount C that is computed by the formula (B ‑ B1) &#215; D, where — ( a ) B is the amount of income B; ( b ) B1 is the part of income B which is derived wholly from any agreement or arrangement entered into on or after the registration date, as well as any other income prescribed by regulations made under section 34G; and ( c ) D is the lower of the following: (i) the rate by which the part of income A derived or received in the basis period in which its registration date falls is chargeable to tax; (ii) the rate by which income B is chargeable to the tax described in subsection (1)( b ).

[39/2017] (9) If, at any time after the registration date, and during a period specified by the Minister to it at the time of its approval, the approved redomiciled company ceases to carry on any trade or business in Singapore, an amount computed using the formula is recoverable by the Comptroller from the company as a debt due to the Government, where — ( a ) F is the total number of its specified years of assessment or 5, whichever is larger; ( b ) G is the total number of complete years where the company carried on a trade or business in Singapore; and ( c ) H is the total amount of tax credits already allowed against the tax chargeable on the income of the company under this section. [39/2017] (10) If the Comptroller is satisfied that — ( a ) the approved redomiciled company gave to the Comptroller information that is false in any material particular, or omitted any material particular from any information or document given to the Comptroller; and ( b ) as a result of the false information or omission, an amount of tax credit was allowed against tax chargeable on the company’s income under this section, then an amount equal to the amount of tax credit so allowed is recoverable by the Comptroller from the company as a debt due to the Government. [39/2017] (11) The amount recoverable under subsection (9) or (10) must be paid at the place stated in the notice served by the Comptroller on the approved redomiciled company within 30 days after the service of the notice. [39/2017] (12) The Comptroller may, in the Comptroller’s discretion, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Comptroller may impose, extend the time within which payment is to be made. [39/2017] (13) Sections 86(1) to (6), 87(1) and (2), 89, 90 and 91 apply to the collection and recovery by the Comptroller of the amount recoverable under subsection (9) or (10) as they apply to the collection and recovery of tax.

(2) Where an election is made by an MSI recipient for a year of assessment that falls within its incentive period — ( a ) its qualifying income for that year of assessment is not exempt from tax under section 13A, 13E or 13P (whichever is applicable) and is also not included in its statutory income for that year of assessment; and ( b ) instead, an amount based on the net tonnage of qualifying ships used by the MSI recipient to derive qualifying income in the basis period, as determined by the Twelfth Schedule (called in this section the deemed income), is added to and treated as part of the assessable income of the MSI recipient for that year of assessment. (3) However, no deduction may be made under section 37B or 37D against an amount treated as part of the assessable income of an MSI recipient under subsection (2)( b ). (4) Despite section 43(6), (6B), (6C) and (6D), tax is levied at the rate prescribed in section 43(1)( a ) on every dollar of the deemed income, and (accordingly) the deemed income does not form part of the chargeable income of the MSI recipient in section 43(6B) and (6D). (5) Despite subsection (2)( a ), expenses mentioned in section 13A(2A) of an MSI recipient that is a shipping enterprise that would otherwise be allocated in accordance with section 13A(2A) in ascertaining its qualifying income, are treated as having been so allocated; and the balance of those expenses is to be applied towards ascertaining any other income of the MSI recipient for the purposes of this Act. (6) An MSI recipient may make an election to adopt the tax treatment under this section by providing a written notice to one or more authorities prescribed by regulations made under subsection (13) (each called an authority), in the form and manner specified by the authority — ( a ) at or before the time it is required to lodge its return of income for any year of assessment (called in this section YA1); or ( b ) within such further time as the authority may allow. (7) An election, once made, is for all of the MSI recipient’s qualifying income derived in its incentive period, and is irrevocable. (8) An MSI recipient may, upon the expiry of its incentive period, make another election for all of its qualifying income within another incentive period to be taxed in accordance with this section, and subsections (6) and (7) apply accordingly. (9) In subsections (7) and (8), “incentive period” means — ( a ) if the MSI recipient is a shipping enterprise and is not an approved international shipping enterprise or approved shipping investment enterprise — the continuous period (not exceeding 10 years) that it owns or operates a qualifying ship, starting on the first day of the basis period for YA1 (day X ) or, if it first owns or operates a qualifying ship on any day (day Y ) after day X , starting on day Y ; ( b ) if the MSI recipient is an approved international shipping enterprise whether or not it also earns any income falling within the meaning of paragraph ( a ) of the definition of “qualifying income” in subsection (14) during the same period — (i) the period of its exemption in section 13E(2) starting on the first day of the basis period for YA1 (day X ) or, if the period of exemption starts on any day (day Y ) after day X , starting on day Y , but excluding in both cases any period of extension of such period of exemption; or (ii) any period of extension of the period of its exemption in section 13E(2) starting on the first day of the basis period for YA1 (day X ) or, if the period of extension starts on any day (day Y ) after day X , starting on day Y ; or ( c ) if the MSI recipient is an approved shipping investment enterprise whether or not it also earns any income falling within the meaning of paragraph ( a ) of the definition of “qualifying income” in subsection (14) during the same period — (i) the period of its approval mentioned in section 13P(3) starting on the first day of the basis period for YA1 (day X ) or, if the period of approval starts on any day (day Y ) after day X , starting on day Y , but in both cases — (A) excluding any period of extension of the approval; and (B) including any period after the period of approval where section 13P(1) continues to apply to its income as described in section 13P(1A) or (1B) after it ceases to be so approved; or (ii) any period of extension of its approval under section 13P(3) starting on the first day of the basis period for YA1 (day X ) or, if the period of extension starts on any day (day Y ) after day X , starting on day Y , and including any period after the period of extension where section 13P(1) continues to apply to its income as described in section 13P(1A) or (1B) after it ceases to be so approved. (10) However, if — ( a ) at the time an MSI recipient that is a shipping enterprise makes an election under subsection (7) or (8), it is not an approved international shipping enterprise or approved shipping investment enterprise; and ( b ) at any time during its incentive period as defined in subsection (9)( a ), the MSI recipient becomes an approved international shipping enterprise or approved shipping investment enterprise (as the case may be), the end date (but not the start date) of the incentive period of the MSI recipient is to be determined in accordance with subsection (9)( b ) or ( c ), as the case may be. (11) Where the incentive period of an MSI recipient covered by an election under this section lapses during a basis period for a year of assessment (called in this section the last YA), the capital allowances that are to be taken into account in determining its income that is exempt from tax under section 13A, 13E or 13P (as the case may be) for the last YA, or that is available as a deduction against any of its income for the last YA, are — ( a ) to be computed on the residue of the capital expenditure or reducing value of the asset concerned (as the case may be) after deducting all such allowances (including initial and annual allowances) that have or would (but for subsection (2)( a )) have been taken into account in determining its exempt income under section 13A, 13E or 13P, as the case may be; and ( b ) reduced by an amount computed by the formula where — (i) A is the number of days between the first day of the basis period and the day the incentive period ends; and (ii) B is the amount of capital allowances computed in paragraph ( a ). (12) For each year of assessment after the last YA, the capital allowances that are to be taken into account in determining the income of the MSI recipient that is exempt from tax under section 13A, 13E or 13P (as the case may be), or that is available as a deduction against any of its income, are to be computed on the residue of the capital expenditure or reducing value of the asset concerned, after deducting — ( a ) all such allowances (including initial and annual allowances) that have or would (but for subsection (2)( a )) have been taken into account in determining its exempt income under section 13A, 13E or 13P, as the case may be; and ( b ) the total amount of such allowances that would have been taken into account in determining its exempt income under section 13A, 13E or 13P (as the case may be), or that would have been available as a deduction against any of its income, for the last YA, but without the reduction in subsection (11)( b ). (13) The Minister may make regulations — ( a ) to modify the application of any provision in Part 14 in relation to any credit to be allowed against any tax payable in respect of the deemed income of an MSI recipient; and ( b ) to prescribe any matter required or permitted to be prescribed under this section. (14) In this section — “approved international shipping enterprise” means an international shipping enterprise as defined in section 13E and approved under that section; “approved shipping investment enterprise” means a shipping investment enterprise as defined in section 13P and approved under that section; “Maritime Sector Incentive recipient” or “MSI recipient” means — ( a ) a shipping enterprise, but only if it owns or operates a qualifying ship; ( b ) an approved international shipping enterprise; or ( c ) an approved shipping investment enterprise, including one the approval of which has expired or been withdrawn but to which section 13P(1) continues to apply by virtue of section 13P(1A) or (1B), but excludes an entity that only operates one or more ships where only a part of each ship was chartered to it; “net tonnage”, in relation to a qualifying ship, means the measure of the useful capacity of the ship stated in a valid certificate of registry, Singapore Tonnage Certificate or International Tonnage Certificate (1969); “provisionally registered ship”, “shipping enterprise” and “Singapore ship” have the meanings given by section 13A(16); “qualifying income”, in relation to an MSI recipient for any year of assessment, means all of the following income (whichever is applicable) of the MSI recipient: ( a ) any income that would have been exempt from tax under section 13A but for this section; ( b ) any income that would have been exempt from tax under section 13E but for this section; ( c ) any income that would have been exempt from tax under section 13P but for this section; “qualifying ship”, in relation to an MSI recipient for any year of assessment, means — ( a ) in the case of an MSI recipient that is a shipping enterprise but not an approved international shipping enterprise or an approved shipping investment enterprise, any Singapore ship or provisionally registered ship; or ( b ) in the case of an MSI recipient that is an approved international shipping enterprise or an approved shipping investment enterprise, any ship, owned or operated by the MSI recipient at any time in the basis period for that year of assessment; “ship” has the meaning given by section 2(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.

(2) There is to be deducted any allowance falling to be made under section 16, 17, 18A (repealed), 18B, 18C, 19, 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D or 20 that is not fully deducted and which would otherwise be added to, and deemed to form part of, the corresponding allowance for the next succeeding year of assessment under section 23(1). (2A) A deduction under subsection (2) is to be made in the following order: ( a ) firstly, against income from any trade, business, profession or vocation; and ( b ) secondly, against income from any other source. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the balance of allowance for the earliest year of assessment is deemed to have been deducted first, followed by the balance of allowance for the next earliest year of assessment, and so on. (4) Where the Comptroller is satisfied that any person usually makes up the person’s accounts to a day other than 31 December, the Comptroller may direct that — ( a ) where the person is not an individual, the statutory income of that person from all sources be computed on the amount of gains or profits of the year ending on that day in the year preceding the year of assessment; ( b ) where the accounts relate to a partnership, the income of the partnership be computed under section 36 on the amount of gains or profits of the year ending on that day in the year preceding the year of assessment; or ( c ) where the person is an individual, the statutory income of that person from any trade, business, profession or vocation to which the accounts relate be computed on the amount of gains or profits of the year ending on that day in the year preceding the year of assessment. (5) [ Deleted by Act 19 of 2013 ] (6) Where the statutory income of any person has been computed by reference to an account made up to a certain day, and such person fails for any reason whatsoever to make up an account to the corresponding day in the year following, the statutory income both of the year of assessment in which such failure occurs and of the 2 years of assessment following is to be computed on such basis as the Comptroller in his or her discretion thinks fit. (7) Where it is necessary in order to arrive at the income of any year of assessment or other period, to divide and apportion to specific periods the income of any period for which accounts have been made up, or to aggregate such income or any apportioned parts thereof, it is lawful to make such a division, and apportionment or aggregation, and any apportionment under this section is to be made in proportion to the number of days in the respective periods, unless the Comptroller, having regard to any special circumstances, otherwise directs. (8) The statutory income of an executor of a deceased person for any year of assessment is the income of the estate administered by such executor computed in accordance with subsections (1) to (7). (9) In the case of an estate administered in Singapore, a deduction is allowed in respect of any income included in the computation of the statutory income if such income is received by, distributed to or applied to the benefit of any beneficiary of the estate within the calendar year in which the income is derived, or such longer period that the Comptroller may permit in any particular case or class of cases.

(3G) Where a donor who makes a donation referred to in subsection (3)( b ), ( c ), ( d ), ( e ) or ( f ), or a person connected with the donor, receives or will receive a benefit in consequence of making the donation, a reference to the value or amount of the donation under that provision excludes an amount equivalent to the value of the benefit. (3H) The Minister may by rules — ( a ) exclude any type of benefit from the application of subsection (3G); and ( b ) provide for the basis for determining the value of any benefit under that subsection.

(6) Where, in any year of assessment, the amount of loss incurred by any person during the year preceding the year of assessment is not fully deducted under subsection (3)( a )(ii), the balance of such loss, after deducting any amount of such loss transferred to a claimant company under section 37B or to a spouse under section 37C or 37E, or deducted against income for the immediate preceding year of assessment under section 37D(1) or any of the 3 immediate preceding years of assessment under section 37D(1A), is available for deduction against the person’s statutory income for subsequent year of assessment under subsection (3)( a )(i). [39/2017; 41/2020] (7) A deduction under this section to any person in respect of any sum allowable under subsection (3)( b ), ( c ), ( d ), ( e ) or ( f ) is only allowed against the person’s statutory income after the deduction under subsection (3)( a ) and sections 37AA, 37AB and 37N.

(9) For the purposes of subsections (7) and (8), any sum allowable under subsection (3)( b ), ( c ), ( d ), ( e ) or ( f ) in respect of any donation made on an earlier date is deemed to have been deducted first. (10) For the purposes of subsection (3), the loss incurred during any year is computed, where the Comptroller so decides, by reference to the year ending on a day in such year which would have been adopted under section 35(4) for the computation of the statutory income of the following year of assessment if a profit had arisen.

[37/2014] (3) Despite the provisions of this Act, the amount referred to in subsection (4) of a PIC cash payout or PIC bonus paid to a person that was based on a claim that arose from an abusive PIC arrangement is recoverable by the Comptroller from the person as a debt due to the Government.

[37/2014] (8) In this section, an arrangement is a PIC arrangement if the obtaining of a PIC cash payout, PIC bonus or PIC enhanced deduction, or a higher amount of a PIC cash payout, PIC bonus or PIC enhanced deduction, was the purpose or one of the purposes of the arrangement (called in this section the relevant purpose). [37/2014] (9) In this section, a PIC arrangement is abusive if — ( a ) it consists or makes use of one or more artificial, contrived or fraudulent steps that are intended to achieve the relevant purpose; ( b ) the arrangement results in the consideration paid or payable for the property or services in question being of a greater value than the open market value of the property or services, and there is no bona fide commercial reason for the difference in the values apart from the relevant purpose; or ( c ) in any other case, there is no bona fide commercial reason for entering into the arrangement or a transaction forming part of the arrangement apart from the relevant purpose.

Examples (i) A enters into a contract for training for A ’s employees. The right to training may be exchanged for goods. Expenditure for the goods is not eligible for a PIC cash payout. A exchanged the right to training for those goods and made a claim for a PIC cash payout in respect of the expenditure. The contract and the exchange together form an abusive PIC arrangement. The amount of the PIC cash payout that results from the arrangement being abusive for the purposes of subsections (1) and (3) is the full amount of the payout. (ii) A , in order to obtain a higher amount of PIC cash payout, purchases more equipment than A needs for A ’s business. The purchase of the excess equipment is an abusive PIC arrangement. The amount of the PIC cash payout that results from the arrangement being abusive for the purposes of subsections (1) and (3) is the amount corresponding to the price paid for the excess equipment. (iii) A and B , in order to help each other obtain a PIC cash payout, sell to each other equipment that performs the same function. The sales are abusive PIC arrangements. The amount of the PIC cash payout that results from the arrangement being abusive for the purposes of subsections (1) and (3) is the full amount of the payout. (iv) A enters into a contract for training for A ’s employees. The contract price for the training includes both the value of the training and the value of other goods to be given to the trainees. Expenditure for those goods is not eligible for a PIC cash payout. The purpose for setting the price for the training in this way is to enable a higher PIC cash payout to be paid to A . The contract is an abusive PIC arrangement. The amount of the PIC cash payout that results from the arrangement being abusive for the purposes of subsections (1) and (3) is the amount corresponding to the price for those other goods.

(2) The election under subsection (1) must — ( a ) be made to the Comptroller by the eligible person — (i) on or before the expiry of the time (including any extended time) for the eligible person to lodge the eligible person’s return of income for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the selected expenditure was incurred, as described in section 62; or (ii) within such extended time as the Comptroller may allow; ( b ) be made using the electronic service, except that the Comptroller may in any particular case or class of cases permit the election to be made in any other manner; and ( c ) be accompanied by such information and supporting document, to be given in such form and manner, as may be specified by the Comptroller.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (1), the amount of cash payout for each year of assessment is where A is the lower of the following: ( a ) the amount of the selected expenditure; ( b ) $100,000.

(7) The election under subsection (6) must — ( a ) be made to the Comptroller by the eligible person — (i) on or before the expiry of the time (including any extended time) for the eligible person to lodge the eligible person’s return of income for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the IPR instalment agreement was signed, as described in section 62; or (ii) within such extended time as the Comptroller may allow; ( b ) be made using the electronic service, except that the Comptroller may in any particular case or class of cases permit the election to be made in any other manner; and ( c ) be accompanied by such information and supporting document, to be given in such form and manner, as may be specified by the Comptroller. (8) The Comptroller may reject any election that is not made in accordance with subsection (7). (9) Where an election under subsection (6) is made, subsection (4) applies with the following modifications: ( a ) the reference to the amount of selected expenditure for a year of assessment, being the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the IPR instalment agreement is signed, is to the aggregate of — (i) the cash price of the intellectual property rights; and (ii) the expenditure mentioned in subsection (1) incurred in that basis period for which a deduction or an allowance is allowable or may be made to the eligible person, and in respect of which an election has been made under that subsection; ( b ) the reference to the amount of selected expenditure for a year of assessment excludes the amount of any capital expenditure made by the eligible person under that IPR instalment agreement in the basis period for that year of assessment. (10) For the purpose of subsections (12) and (22), the amount of cash payout for any intellectual property rights that are the subject of an IPR instalment agreement is the amount computed under subsection (4) (as modified by subsection (9)) that is attributable to — ( a ) the cash price of the intellectual property rights; or ( b ) if the amount of A is $100,000, such part of that amount that the eligible person specifies to be attributable to the cash price of the intellectual property rights. (11) In subsections (9)( a )(i) and (10)( a ), a reference to the cash price of the intellectual property rights is, in a case where section 19B(10I) applies, to the open‑market price mentioned in section 19B(10F) for those intellectual property rights. (12) The cash payout for a year of assessment under subsection (6) for any intellectual property rights that are the subject of an IPR instalment agreement must be made to the eligible person in the following manner: ( a ) the eligible person may claim an amount of cash payout for the year of assessment relating to a basis period during which the eligible person incurred capital expenditure under the agreement for those rights; ( b ) the amount of cash payout that may be made to the eligible person is the lesser of — (i) A &#215; 20%, where A is the amount of the capital expenditure incurred in that basis period; and (ii) the amount mentioned in subsection (10) after deducting any cash payout made for those rights in any preceding year of assessment or years of assessment under this subsection; ( c ) no cash payout may be made for those rights if the amount mentioned in paragraph ( b )(ii) is zero; ( d ) each claim must be made in a form and be accompanied by any information and supporting document relating to the capital expenditure specified by the Comptroller; ( e ) to avoid doubt, a claim may be made for any year of assessment after the year of assessment 2028.

Section 14A costs deductible for 2 or more consecutive years of assessment treated as incurred on date of approval or rejection of application for registration of intellectual property rights, etc. (15) For the purposes of this section, where — ( a ) an eligible person has incurred qualifying intellectual property registration costs in respect of an application for the registration or grant of a qualifying intellectual property right for which a deduction is allowable under section 14A(1)( b ) and (1BC), over the basis periods of 2 or more consecutive years of assessment; ( b ) the eligible person is not disqualified from making an election under subsection (1) by reason of subsection (13)( b ); and ( c ) the eligible person makes an election under subsection (1) in respect of those costs, the eligible person is treated as having incurred those costs during the basis period of the year of assessment in which the application or grant is approved or rejected. When open-market price treated as section 19B expenditure (16) Where the Comptroller has treated the open‑market price as the capital expenditure incurred for the acquisition of intellectual property rights under section 19B(10E), then the reference in this section to selected expenditure, insofar as it relates to that capital expenditure, is to the open‑market price of the intellectual property rights. Election deemed made on full amount of section 14A or 19B expenditure (17) Where an eligible person makes an election under subsection (1) or (6) in respect of a deduction or an allowance under section 14A(1)( b ) and (1BC) or 19B(1AA) and (1AD), the election is treated as having been made on the full amount of the expenditure qualifying for the deduction or allowance and incurred on — ( a ) the grant or registration of each qualifying intellectual property right in each country; or ( b ) the acquisition of each intellectual property right, as the case may be, to which the election relates, net of any grant or subsidy from the Government or a statutory board. (18) No part of the amount of any expenditure mentioned in subsection (17) for which an election is made or treated as having been made under subsection (1) or (6) is eligible for a deduction or an allowance against the income of the eligible person for any year of assessment. Capital expenditure in acquiring rights in software for licensing not eligible for cash payout (19) Despite subsections (1) and (6), where an eligible person has incurred capital expenditure in acquiring any intellectual property rights in any software for the purpose of licensing all or any part of those rights, the eligible person is not allowed to make an election under subsection (1) or (6) in respect of such expenditure.

(1A) To avoid doubt, this section — ( a ) does not apply where the tax payable in respect of income in that territory is an excluded top-up tax; and ( b ) applies where the tax payable in respect of income in that territory is a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax that is payable — (i) in respect of the income of a permanent establishment in a territory; or (ii) in the cases in subsections (5)( c ) and (7)( a ), by a company in respect of the profits out of which it pays the dividend. [Act 36 of 2024 wef 20/03/2025] (2) The amount of the income tax chargeable in respect of the income is reduced by the amount of the credit; except that credit is not allowed against income tax for any year of assessment unless the person entitled to the income is resident in Singapore during that year. (3) The credit must not exceed the amount which would be produced by computing the amount of the income in accordance with the provisions of this Act and then charging it to income tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the income tax chargeable (before allowance of credit under any arrangements having effect under section 49) on the assessable income of the person entitled to the income by the amount of the person’s assessable income. (4) Without limiting subsection (3), the total credit to be allowed to a person for any year of assessment for foreign tax under all arrangements having effect under section 49 must not exceed the total income tax payable by the person for that year of assessment, excluding any tax payable by the person under section 45. (5) In computing the amount of the income — ( a ) no deduction is allowed in respect of foreign tax (whether in respect of the same or any other income); ( b ) where the income tax chargeable depends on the amount received in Singapore, that amount is to be increased by the appropriate amount of the foreign tax in respect of the income; and ( c ) where the income includes a dividend and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any (and if so what) credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the income is to be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable that falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit. (6) Subsection (5)( a ) and ( b ) applies to the computation of assessable income for the purposes of determining the rate mentioned in subsection (3), and applies to such computation in relation to all income in the case of which credit falls to be given for foreign tax under arrangements for the time being in force under section 49. (7) Where — ( a ) the arrangements provide, in relation to dividends of some classes, but not in relation to dividends of other classes, that foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of dividends is to be taken into account in considering whether any (and if so what) credit is to be given against income tax in respect of the dividends; and ( b ) a dividend is paid that is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide, then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than one‑half of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, credit is to be allowed as if the dividend were a dividend of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide. (8) Credit is not allowed under the arrangements against income tax chargeable in respect of the income of any person for any year of assessment if the person elects that credit is not to be allowed in the case of the person’s income for that year. (9) Any claim for an allowance by way of credit must be made not later than 2 years after the end of the year of assessment to which the claim relates (if the year of assessment is the year of assessment 2021 or a previous year of assessment), or 4 years after the end of the year of assessment to which the claim relates (if the year of assessment is any other year of assessment), and in the event of any dispute as to the amount allowable the claim is subject to objection and appeal in like manner as an assessment. [27/2021] (10) Where the amount of any credit given under the arrangements is rendered excessive or insufficient by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable either in Singapore or elsewhere, nothing in this Act limiting the time for the making of assessments or claims for relief applies to any assessment or claim to which the adjustment gives rise, being an assessment or claim made not later than 3 years from the time when all such assessments, adjustments and other determinations have been made, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, as are material in determining whether any (and if so what) credit falls to be given. [27/2021] (11) If the amount of any credit given under the arrangements to a person is rendered excessive by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable in any territory outside Singapore, the person must give the Comptroller a written notice of the particulars of the adjustment, in the manner specified by the Comptroller, within one year after the adjustment is made. [27/2021] (11A) Any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with subsection (11) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a penalty not exceeding the amount of the excess credit under subsection (11). [27/2021] (11B) The Comptroller may compound any offence under subsection (11A).

(3) Where under arrangements for the time being in force under section 49 with the government of any territory outside Singapore no provision is made for tax credit in respect of income out of which any dividend is paid by a company resident in that territory, tax credit under section 50 in respect of such income must be given to any person resident in Singapore who owns not less than 25% of the total number of issued shares of the company paying the dividend.

[41/2020] (1A) A non‑resident person is assessable and chargeable in respect of any income arising, directly or indirectly, through or from any attorneyship, factorship, agency, receivership, branch or management, and is so assessable and chargeable in the name of the attorney, factor, agent, receiver, branch or manager. (2) A non‑resident beneficiary of the estate of a deceased person is, where the estate is being administered in Singapore, assessable and chargeable in respect of the income received by or distributed to the non‑resident beneficiary or applied to the non‑resident beneficiary’s benefit in the name of the executor of the estate as if the executor were an agent of the non‑resident beneficiary. (2A) Where a non‑resident person carries on business with a resident person and it appears to the Comptroller that, owing to the close connection between the resident person and the non‑resident person and to the substantial control exercised by the non‑resident person over the resident person, the course of business between those persons can be so arranged and is so arranged that the business done by the resident person pursuant to the resident person’s connection with the non‑resident person produces to the resident person either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise from that business, the non‑resident person is assessable and chargeable to tax in the name of the resident person as if the resident person were an agent of the non‑resident person. (3) Where the true amount of the gains or profits of any non‑resident person chargeable with tax in the name of a resident person cannot in any case be readily ascertained, the Comptroller may, if he or she thinks fit, assess and charge the non‑resident person on a fair and reasonable percentage of the turnover of the business done by the non‑resident person through or with the resident person in whose name the non‑resident person is chargeable as aforesaid, and in such case the provisions of this Act relating to the delivery of returns or particulars by persons acting on behalf of others extend so as to require returns or particulars to be furnished by the resident person of the business so done by the non‑resident person through or with the resident person, in the same manner as returns or particulars are to be delivered by persons acting for incapacitated or non‑resident persons of income to be charged. (3A) The amount of the percentage under subsection (3) must in each case be determined with regard to the nature of the business and is, when determined by the Comptroller, subject to appeal in accordance with the provisions of Part 18. (4) This section does not render a non‑resident person chargeable in the name of a broker or general commission agent or other agent where such broker, general commission agent or agent is not an authorised person carrying on the regular agency of the non‑resident person, or person chargeable as if the person were an agent pursuant to subsections (2A) and (3), in respect of gains or profits arising from sales or transactions carried out through such a broker or agent. (5) The fact that a non‑resident person executes sales or carries out transactions with other non‑resident persons in circumstances which would make the non‑resident person chargeable pursuant to subsections (2A) and (3) in the name of a resident person does not of itself make the non‑resident person chargeable in respect of gains or profits arising from those sales or transactions. (6) Where a non‑resident person is chargeable to tax in the name of any attorney, factor, agent, receiver or manager, in respect of any gains or profits arising from the sale of goods or produce manufactured or produced outside Singapore by the non‑resident person, the person in whose name the non‑resident person is so chargeable may, if the person thinks fit, apply to the Comptroller to have the assessment to tax in respect of those gains or profits made or amended on the basis of the profits which might reasonably be expected to have been earned by a merchant or, where the goods are retailed by or on behalf of the manufacturer or producer, by a retailer of the goods sold, who had bought from the manufacturer or producer direct, and on proof to the Comptroller’s satisfaction of the amount of the profits on that basis, the assessment must be made or amended accordingly. (7) The master of any ship (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995) and the captain of any aircraft owned or chartered by a non‑resident person who is chargeable under section 12(2) are (though not to the exclusion of any other agent) deemed the agents of such non‑resident person for all the purposes of this Act. [2/2016] (8) The income of any non‑resident partner or partners from a partnership is assessable in the name of the partnership or of any resident partner or of any agent of the partnership in Singapore, and the tax charged thereon is recoverable by all means provided in this Act out of the assets of the partnership or from any partner or from any such agent."

      "content": "76. —(1) The Comptroller must cause each person assessed to tax to be served, in accordance with section 8(1), with — ( a ) where tax is payable, a notice stating the amount of the person’s chargeable income together with the amount of tax payable and the place at which such payment should be made; or ( b ) where no tax is payable, a notice to that effect, and in either case the Comptroller must inform the person assessed to tax of the person’s rights under subsections (2) and (3) and (if applicable) the person’s duty under subsection (8). (2) If any person disputes the assessment, the person may apply to the Comptroller, by written notice of objection, to review and to revise the assessment made upon the person. (2A) If the objection is made to any assessment, being one which — ( a ) is made on or after 20 December 2011; and ( b ) amends a previous assessment in any particular, then a person’s right to object to the assessment is limited to a right to object against the amendment in respect of, or matters relating to, that particular. (2B) In subsection (2A), the reference to an assessment which amends a previous assessment in any particular includes one which amends the amount of unabsorbed losses, allowances or donations in that previous assessment that may be carried forward but the tax payable remains nil. (3) Such application must state precisely the grounds of the person’s objections to the assessment and must be made within — ( a ) if the person is a company and the notice of assessment is served on the person on or after 1 January 2014, 2 months; or ( b ) in any other case, 30 days, from the date of the service of the notice of assessment. [34/2016] (4) The Comptroller upon being satisfied that, owing to absence, sickness or other reasonable cause, the person disputing the assessment was prevented from making the application within the period referred to in subsection (3), must extend the period as may be reasonable in the circumstances. (5) On receipt of the notice of objection mentioned in subsection (2), the Comptroller may — ( a ) require the person giving the notice of objection to furnish such particulars as the Comptroller may consider necessary with respect to the person’s income assessed and to produce all books or other documents in the person’s custody or under the person’s control relating to such income; and ( b ) summon any person who the Comptroller thinks is able to give evidence respecting the assessment to attend before the Comptroller and may examine that person on oath or otherwise. (6) In the event of any person who has objected to an assessment made upon that person — ( a ) agreeing with the Comptroller as to the amount at which that person is liable to be assessed, the assessment must be amended accordingly, and notice of the revised assessment must be served upon that person; or ( b ) failing to agree with the Comptroller as to the amount at which that person is liable to be assessed, the Comptroller must give that person notice of refusal to amend the assessment and may revise the assessment to such amount as the Comptroller may determine, according to the best of the Comptroller’s judgment, and the Comptroller must give that person notice of the revised assessment and of the tax payable, or the amount of refund of tax (as a result of the operation of section 46) or unabsorbed allowances, losses or donations, together with notice of refusal to amend the revised assessment. (7) Wherever requisite, any reference in this Act to an assessment or an additional assessment includes a reference to an assessment or additional assessment as revised under subsection (6)( b ). (8) If any incorrect information appears in a notice of assessment for any year of assessment served on a person who is exempted from the liability to furnish a return under section 62(2), the person must, within 30 days from the date of service of the notice or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow, inform the Comptroller by written notice — ( a ) if the incorrect information relates to any understatement or omission of income, of the correct amount of income from every source for that year of assessment; or ( b ) if the incorrect information relates to any deduction or relief which is excessive or which is wrongly granted, of the correct amount of deduction or relief for that year of assessment or the fact that the deduction or relief is wrongly granted, as the case may be. (9) The Minister may, by rules made under section 7, substitute a longer period for a period in subsection (3) or (8) for all persons or cases, any class of persons or cases, or any person or case, and subsection (3) or (8) (as the case may be) applies accordingly to all persons or cases, the class of persons or cases, or the person or case. [34/2016] (10) The rules mentioned in subsection (9) may — ( a ) provide that the substitute period applies only if such conditions as may be specified in the rules are satisfied; and ( b ) prescribe different substitute periods for different persons or cases and classes of persons or cases.

(19) In this section, an “eligible subsidiary” of a company is a company that is wholly-owned (directly or indirectly) by the company and has a financial year that ends on the same day as that of the company. (20) If any nominee approved by the Minister or authorised body (including one approved under subsection (22)) is in liquidation, ceases to carry on a trade or business in Singapore or ceases to exist at any time during the basis period for a year of assessment, then the approval of that nominee is treated as revoked as of the first day of that basis period in which the date of commencement of the liquidation or cessation falls.

(24) A company that is approved as a financial sector incentive company for the purposes of section 43J(1B), or its holding company, may not be nominated under subsection (15)( a ), (16) or (22). (25) The application under subsection (15), (16) or (22) must be accompanied by such information and documents as the Minister or authorised body may require. (26) Where an approval is granted in respect of one or more nominees (including a replacement nominee) of an approved company, the rebate to be made to the approved company (as determined by subsections (10) to (13)) is instead to be made — ( a ) first against the tax payable by the approved company in a year of assessment; and ( b ) then against the tax payable by those approved nominees in the same ye"

[28/2019] [Act 41 of 2020 wef 06/12/2022] (16) The amount of any tax recoverable from the umbrella VCC under the regulations made under section 13U that is attributable to any income of a sub‑fund, is considered (for the purpose of section 29 of the VCC Act) liability incurred by the umbrella VCC for the purpose of the sub‑fund.
