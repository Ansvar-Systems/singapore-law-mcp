(2) The Authority must cause to be prepared — ( a ) plans and specifications of the street works; ( b ) an estimate of the costs and expenses thereof; and ( c ) a provisional apportionment of the estimated costs and expenses among the owners mentioned in subsection (1) and the owners of such other premises (if any) as the Authority may, in accordance with subsection (3), decide to include in the provisional apportionment, and must serve a notice of its decision in writing upon each such owner, requiring that owner to execute to the satisfaction and in accordance with the directions in writing of the Authority, such street works within such period as may be specified in the notice commencing from the date of the service of the notice. (3) In such a provisional apportionment of the costs and expenses of the street works, the apportionment of costs and expenses among the owners of the premises fronting, adjoining or abutting on the private street or part thereof in respect of which the costs and expenses are to be incurred must, unless the Authority otherwise decides, be apportioned according to the frontage of the respective premises; but the Authority may, if it thinks fit, decide that in settling the apportionment regard must be had to the following considerations: ( a ) the degree of benefit to be derived by any premises from the street works; ( b ) the amount and value of any street works already executed by the owners or occupiers of any such premises, and the Authority may, if it thinks fit — ( c ) include any premises which do not front, adjoin or abut on the private street or part thereof but access to which is obtained from the street through another street or backlane and which, in its opinion, will be benefited by the street works; and ( d ) fix the sum or proportion to be charged against any such premises accordingly.

(11) Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Authority may, within 14 days of the publication of the notice under subsection (10), appeal to the Minister whose decision is final. (12) If such street works — ( a ) are not commenced within 14 days from the date of such confirmation or amendment or the date on which the plans, specifications, estimate and provisional apportionment are confirmed or amended by the Minister, as the case may be; or ( b ) having been commenced are thereafter suspended or are not completed within the period specified in the notice mentioned in subsection (2), the Authority may, if it thinks fit, cause them to be executed and completed.

(16) The declaration referred to in subsection (15) must be published in the Gazette . (17) Where a private street or part thereof that is declared to be a public street and to be vested in the Government comprises separate lots already set aside as part of a street, the declaration must be registered against those lots — ( a ) under the Land Titles Act 1993 in respect of registered land; and ( b ) under the Registration of Deeds Act 1988 in respect of other land.
