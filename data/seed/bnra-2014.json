(4) Despite this section and section 18, where the Registrar is satisfied that a person’s registered business name — ( a ) is one that is not permitted to be registered under subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( d ); ( b ) is one that is not permitted to be registered under subsection (2) until the expiry of the relevant period referred to in that subsection; ( c ) is one that is permitted to be registered under subsection (3) only after the expiry of the relevant period referred to in that subsection; ( d ) so nearly resembles the name of any corporation or limited partnership, or any registered business name, as to be likely to be mistaken for it; or ( e ) is one the use of which has been restrained by an injunction granted under the Trade Marks Act 1998, the Registrar may direct the person to change the person’s registered business name, and the person must comply with the direction within 6 weeks after the date of the direction or such longer period as the Registrar may allow in any case.

(10) To avoid doubt, where the Registrar makes a direction under subsection (4) or the Minister makes a decision on an appeal under subsection (9), the Registrar or the Minister (as the case may be) must accept as correct any decision of the General Division of the High Court to grant an injunction referred to in subsection (4)( e ).
