(2) Upon the happening, on or after the date of commencement of section 6 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2021, of a disqualifying event for a relevant impost relating to a vehicle which has not ceased to be kept or used on any road in Singapore and has not been destroyed or removed from Singapore, a tax is payable as follows: ( a ) upon the happening of the earlier of the following: (i) at the end of one month after the disqualifying event for the relevant impost happens; (ii) the re‑registration of the vehicle after the disqualifying event for the relevant impost; ( b ) at the end of any period of extension allowed by the Registrar for payment of that tax. (3) The tax under subsection (2) is payable and recoverable from the person who is keeping or using the vehicle when the disqualifying event happens for a relevant impost with respect to that vehicle. (4) The tax under subsection (2) with respect to a vehicle is as follows, whichever being applicable: ( a ) where the disqualifying event relates to any tax payable under section 11 upon the first registration of a vehicle — an amount worked out in the prescribed manner, which must not exceed the amount of the tax that would have been payable under section 11(1)( a ) on the first registration of the vehicle if not for an event in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ); ( b ) where the disqualifying event relates to any levy payable under section 10A — an amount worked out in the prescribed manner, which must not exceed the amount of the levy that would have been payable under section 10A(2) on the first registration of the vehicle with a permit if not for an event in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ); ( c ) where the disqualifying event relates to any other relevant impost — an amount worked out in the prescribed manner, which must not exceed the total amount of the relevant impost that would have been payable if the event in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ) did not happen. (5) To avoid doubt, a vehicle to which this section applies may be the subject of different disqualifying events for different relevant imposts. (6) To ascertain the relevant impost that was not payable upon the first registration, continued registration or the keeping or use on roads, of the vehicle concerned, any rebate from that relevant impost that may be claimed under section 11 when the vehicle was first registered must be reckoned. (7) Any person who gives any incorrect information in relation to any matter affecting the amount of tax chargeable under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, and the court shall order the person to pay the amount of tax which has been undercharged. (8) The amount of the tax under this section which has been undercharged and ordered under subsection (7) to be paid may be recovered according to the law for the time being in force for the recovery of fines. (9) The Registrar may compound any offence punishable under subsection (7) by collecting from the person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence a sum not exceeding $1,000 and the amount of the tax undercharged, and may before judgment stay or compound any proceedings thereunder. (10) In this section — “disqualifying event”, in relation to a relevant impost for a vehicle, means any of the following, whichever happens first: ( a ) the expiry of any period the relevant impost is not payable with respect to the vehicle because of an event in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ); ( b ) the cancellation of the registration of the vehicle under section 27(1) or (1A); ( c ) the first breach of any condition (whether a condition precedent or a condition subsequent) that the exemption described in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ) with respect to the vehicle is subject; “relevant impost”, in relation to any vehicle, means any of the following taxes, fees or levies otherwise payable in respect of the vehicle if not for an event in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ): ( a ) any fee payable under section 10; ( b ) any levy payable under section 10A(2); ( c ) any tax payable under section 11; ( d ) any carbon emission tax payable under section 11AA as in force immediately before 1 January 2018, or any vehicular emission tax payable under that section as in force on or after that date.

(9) Where the applicant is subject to any restriction with respect to the driving of any class of motor vehicle, the extent of the restriction must be specified in the prescribed manner on the driving licence. (10) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules, unless earlier revoked or surrendered — ( a ) a driving licence granted to a person who is, or a renewed driving licence of a person who becomes, a citizen of Singapore or permanent resident of Singapore remains in force for the lifetime of that person; and [Act 31 of 2023 wef 31/12/2024] ( b ) a driving licence granted to, or a renewed driving licence of, a person who is not a citizen of Singapore or permanent resident of Singapore remains in force for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of such grant or renewal (as the case may be) or any shorter period that the Deputy Commissioner of Police may specify in any particular case. [Act 31 of 2023 wef 31/12/2024] [28/2014; 10/2017] (10A) Despite subsection (10) but subject to the other provisions of this Act, a driving licence mentioned in subsection (10)( a ) or ( b ) ceases to be in force when the person who holds the driving licence attains any of the prescribed ages applicable to the person, unless before attaining that age — ( a ) the person undergoes the prescribed medical examination and is duly certified by a registered medical practitioner as being physically fit to drive a motor vehicle of the class or description in that licence; and ( b ) the person passes the whole or any part of the prescribed test of competence to drive that the Deputy Commissioner of Police may require for the person to drive a motor vehicle of the class or description in that licence. [28/2014] (11) Subsection (10) does not apply to a provisional licence referred to in section 36(3). (12) [ Deleted by Act 28 of 2014 ] (13) The Deputy Commissioner of Police may refuse to renew any driving licence if the Deputy Commissioner of Police is satisfied — ( a ) that the holder of the driving licence has not complied with any process of court issued against him or her in respect of any offence committed by him or her under this Act or the rules or any written law specified in Part 2 of the First Schedule; or ( b ) that the holder of the driving licence has, pursuant to a warrant of court, been arrested in connection with an offence under this Act or the rules or any written law specified in Part 2 of the First Schedule and the offence has not been tried and determined by the court. [28/2014; 10/2017] (14) Subject to subsection (15), the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette , amend Part 2 of the First Schedule. (15) The Minister must, before exercising his or her powers under subsection (14), consult the Minister responsible for the written law to which the amendment relates. (16) Where a person’s driving licence has ceased to be in force for a period of 3 years or more, the Deputy Commissioner of Police must not grant another driving licence to the person authorising the person to drive a class or description of motor vehicle unless — ( a ) the person passes the test of competence to drive referred to in section 36(1); or ( b ) the Deputy Commissioner of Police is satisfied that, at any time within 3 years before the date that the person applies for the other driving licence, the person held a driver’s certificate or licence granted by the competent authority in any country other than Singapore authorising the person to drive a motor vehicle of that class or description. [28/2014] (17) A person is disqualified from obtaining a driving licence — ( a ) while another driving licence granted to him or her is in force whether the licence is suspended or not; ( b ) if he or she is, by a conviction under this Act or by an order of a court in Singapore or Malaysia, disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence. (18) In any proceedings, the fact that a driving licence has been granted to a person is evidence that the person for the purpose of obtaining the licence made a declaration that he or she was not disqualified from holding or obtaining the licence. (19) If any person is aggrieved by the refusal of the Deputy Commissioner of Police to grant or renew a driving licence or by the revocation of a driving licence under section 37, he or she may, after giving the Deputy Commissioner of Police notice of his or her intention to do so, appeal to the Commissioner of Police and on the appeal the Commissioner of Police may make any order that the Commissioner of Police thinks fit and any order so made is binding on the Deputy Commissioner of Police.

      "content": "95B. —(1) Without affecting section 95 or 95A, an order for the forfeiture of a vehicle seized or taken to a place of safety under section 95 or 95A may be made by the Authority if it is satisfied that — ( a ) the vehicle is a non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, a non‑compliant personal mobility device or a non‑compliant mobility vehicle; ( b ) an offence under section 5, 5A, 5B or 10 or any rules made under section 6 has been committed and that the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, non‑compliant personal mobility device or non‑compliant mobility vehicle (as the case may be) was the subject matter, or was used in the commission, of the offence; ( ba ) at the end of 30 days after the date of the seizure or taking to a place of safety, no claim to the vehicle is earlier made in the prescribed manner to the Authority by a person who is not the person from whom the vehicle was seized or required to take the vehicle to a place of safety (or the latter person’s agent); and ( c ) a person is convicted of the offence, or a person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence has that offence compounded under section 135. [10/2017; 26/2020] (2) Despite subsection (1), the Authority may at once order the forfeiture of a vehicle seized or taken to a place of safety under section 95 or 95A — ( a ) that is a non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, non‑compliant personal mobility device or non‑compliant mobility vehicle; and ( b ) that the Authority considers is of such a nature or in such condition that it would be dangerous for the Authority to retain custody, or its detention in a place of safety materially increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire at the place of safety. [26/2020] (3) Upon receipt of a claim mentioned in subsection (1)( ba ), the Authority may direct that the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, non‑compliant personal mobility device or non‑compliant mobility vehicle be released or may refer the matter by information to a Magistrate. [10/2017; 26/2020] (4) The Magistrate is to, on receipt of an information under subsection (3), or on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, hold an inquiry and proceed to determine the matter, and — ( a ) must order the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, the non‑compliant personal mobility device or the non‑compliant mobility vehicle (as the case may be) to be forfeited on proof that the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, the non‑compliant personal mobility device or the non‑compliant mobility vehicle was used in the commission of an offence under section 5, 5A, 5B or 10 or any rules made under section 6; or ( b ) may, in the absence of that proof, order the release of the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, the non‑compliant personal mobility device or the non‑compliant mobility vehicle, as the case may be. [10/2017; 26/2020] (5) In any proceedings under subsection (4), the burden of proof lies on the person asserting that the person is the owner of the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, the non‑compliant personal mobility device or the non‑compliant mobility vehicle concerned, and on the person from whom the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, the non‑compliant personal mobility device or the non‑compliant mobility vehicle was seized, as the case may be. [10/2017; 26/2020] (6) In any proceedings in any court under subsection (4) in respect of the forfeiture of any vehicle seized in the exercise or the purported exercise of any power conferred under section 95 or 95A, no person is entitled to the costs of the proceedings or to any damages or other relief except an order for the return of the vehicle, unless the seizure was made without reasonable or probable cause. [10/2017] (7) Where any non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, non‑compliant personal mobility device or non‑compliant mobility vehicle is forfeited by the Authority under this section, the Authority may, after giving one month’s notice in the Gazette of the Authority’s intention to do so — ( a ) sell by public auction or tender the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, non-compliant personal mobility device or non-compliant mobility vehicle and any uncollected item left in or on it; and a purchaser of any vehicle, article, item or thing sold in accordance with this paragraph acquires good title to that vehicle, article, item or thing; or ( b ) destroy or otherwise dispose of the non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, non-compliant personal mobility device or non-compliant mobility vehicle, article, item or thing, as the case may be. [10/2017; 26/2020] (7A) However, the Authority may direct that a non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle, non‑compliant personal mobility device or non‑compliant mobility vehicle forfeited by the Authority under subsection (2) and which is the subject of a notice under subsection (7) be returned to a person if — ( a ) before the end of the period of the notice in subsection (7), the Authority receives from that person a written objection to the intended sale, destruction or disposal of the vehicle and showing good cause why possession of the vehicle should be returned to the person; and ( b ) there is no reasonable cause for the Authority to believe that an offence under this Act has been committed and the vehicle was the subject matter, or was used in the commission, of the offence. [26/2020] (8) The proceeds of a sale by public auction or tender of any vehicle, article, item or thing under subsection (7) must be applied as follows: ( a ) firstly, in payment of the expenses occasioned by the sale; ( b ) secondly, in payment of storage or other expenses incurred by the Authority in relation to the vehicle, article, item or thing; ( c ) thirdly, by payment of the balance into the Consolidated Fund. [10/2017] (9) In this section — “non‑compliant mobility vehicle” has the meaning given by the Active Mobility Act 2017; “non‑compliant personal mobility device” means a personal mobility device the construction, weight or accessories of which do not comply with the requirements as to construction, weight and accessories prescribed under the Active Mobility Act 2017 either for all personal mobility devices generally or for the particular type of that personal mobility device; “non‑compliant power‑assisted bicycle” means a power‑assisted bicycle the construction, weight or accessories of which do not comply with the requirements as to construction, weight and accessories prescribed under section 6 or the rules made under that section either for all power‑assisted bicycles generally or for the particular type of that power‑assisted bicycle.

(2) An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under this section may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under section 116(7) has been or will be held.

(2) The notice may as regards both weight of vehicle and axle weight specify different maximum weights in relation to a vehicle travelling at a speed less than a speed specified in the notice and in relation to a vehicle travelling at that speed or any greater speed. (3) In this section — ( a ) “placed in a proper position” means placed in such a position either on or near the bridge or on or near the road leading to the bridge as to be visible at a reasonable distance from the bridge to the drivers of vehicles approaching it; ( b ) “weight” means the actual weight of the vehicle at the time including the weight of every person and thing carried by it; and ( c ) the weight transmitted by a vehicle to any transverse strip of the road surface 152.4 centimetres in breadth is taken as being an “axle weight” of that vehicle and for the purposes of this paragraph a vehicle and any trailer drawn thereby is deemed to be a single vehicle. (4) The fact that a prohibition mentioned in subsection (1) has been made by the Authority and has been notified in the manner prescribed in that subsection must be published in the Gazette . (5) Any omission to so publish the prohibition and notification does not affect the validity of the prohibition or notification. (6) If without the consent of the Authority, a vehicle is driven across a bridge in contravention of this section, any person who so drives it or causes or permits it to be so driven shall, without prejudice to any civil liability incurred by the person in the case of damage being caused to the bridge or otherwise, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $400 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $1,000. (7) If, in any proceedings under this section, the prosecutor satisfies the court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the weight of the vehicle exceeded the maximum weight specified in the notice or that any axle weight of the vehicle exceeded the maximum axle weight so specified, the burden lies on the defendant to prove that the weight of the vehicle or every axle weight of the vehicle (as the case may be) did not exceed the maximum weight or maximum axle weight."
