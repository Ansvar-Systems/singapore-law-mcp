(3) If any person acts as a collector for the purposes of a collection, then, unless there is in force, at all times when he so acts, a licence authorising a promoter under whose authority he acts, or authorising the collector himself, to promote that collection, he shall be guilty of an offence."

      "content": "4. —(1) Where any person who desires to promote a collection in Singapore makes to the Commissioner of Police an application in the prescribed manner specifying the purpose of the collection, and furnishes him with the prescribed information, the Commissioner of Police shall, subject to the following provisions of this section and to such conditions as he thinks fit to impose, grant to the person a licence authorising the person to promote a collection for that purpose. (2) A licence granted under this section shall be for such period as the Commissioner of Police may in his discretion determine, and the period in respect of which the licence is granted shall be specified in the licence. (3) Every application for a licence shall specify an address within Singapore for service on the applicant of any notice or other communication required to be served on him. (4) The Commissioner of Police may, in his discretion, refuse to grant a licence or may at any time revoke a licence granted by him, if it appears to him — ( a ) that the total amount likely to be applied for the purpose of the collection from the proceeds of the collection (including any amount already so applied) is inadequate in proportion to the value of the proceeds likely to be received (including any proceeds already received); ( b ) that remuneration which is excessive in relation to the total amount referred to in paragraph ( a ) is likely to be, or has been, retained or received out of the proceeds of the collection by any person; ( c ) that the grant of a licence would be likely to facilitate the commission of an offence under any written law, or that any such offence has been committed in connection with the collection, and in particular, that any force, threat or compulsion is likely to be, or has been, used in order to obtain any contribution for the purpose of the collection; ( d ) that the applicant or the holder of the licence is not a fit and proper person to hold a licence by reason of the fact that he has been convicted, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, of any offence conviction for which necessarily involved or implied a finding that he had acted fraudulently or dishonestly, or of any offence of a kind the commission of which would be likely to be facilitated by the grant of a licence; ( e ) that the applicant or the holder of the licence, in promoting a collection in respect of which a licence has been granted to him, has failed to exercise due diligence to ensure that persons authorised by him to act as collectors for the purposes of the collection were fit and proper persons to secure compliance on the part of persons so authorised with the provisions of this Act or any of its regulations, or to prevent prescribed badges or prescribed certificates of authority being obtained by persons not so authorised; ( f ) that the collection is in aid of, or that the promoter or any of the collectors are members of, an unlawful society, or that the purpose of the collection is illegal, fictitious or objectionable on grounds of public policy, or that the refusal or revocation of a licence is otherwise desirable in the public interest; or ( g ) that the applicant or the holder of the licence has furnished false information to the Commissioner of Police or has refused or neglected to furnish to the Commissioner of Police such information as he may have reasonably required for the purpose of informing himself as to any of the matters specified in paragraphs ( a ) to ( f ). (5) Subject to subsection (6), when the Commissioner of Police refuses to grant a licence or revokes a licence which has been granted, the Commissioner of Police shall forthwith give written notice to the applicant or the holder of the licence stating upon which one or more of the grounds set out in subsection (4) the licence has been refused or revoked and informing him of the right of appeal given by this section, and the applicant or the holder of the licence may then appeal to the Minister against the refusal or revocation of the licence, as the case may be, and the decision of the Minister shall be final. (6) In any case in which the refusal or revocation by the Commissioner of Police under subsection (5) was based on any ground mentioned in subsection (4)( f ), the Commissioner of Police may decline to state his reasons for the refusal or revocation or to disclose the nature or source of the information on which he acted. (7) The time within which any such appeal may be brought shall be 14 days from the date on which notice is given under subsection (5). (8) If the Minister decides that the appeal shall be allowed, the Commissioner of Police shall forthwith grant a licence or cancel the revocation, as the case may be, in accordance with the decision of the Minister."
