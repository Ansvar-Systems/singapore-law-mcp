(2) The trustees are not under any obligation and are not chargeable with any breach of trust by reason of any omission — ( a ) to apply for any stop or other similar order upon any securities or other property out of or on which any share or interest or other thing in action mentioned in subsection (1) is derived, payable or charged; or ( b ) to take any proceedings on account of any act, default or neglect on the part of the persons in whom those securities or other property or any of them or any part of them is for the time being, or had at any time been, vested, unless required in writing to do so by some person, or the guardian of some person, beneficially interested under the trust, and unless also due provision is made to their satisfaction for payment of the costs of any proceedings required to be taken. (3) Nothing in subsection (2) relieves the trustees of the obligation to get in and obtain payment or transfer of the share or interest or other thing in action on the same falling into possession. (4) Trustees may, for the purpose of giving effect to the trust, or any of the provisions of the instrument (if any) creating the trust or of any statute, from time to time (by duly qualified agents) ascertain and fix the value of any trust property in any manner that they think proper and any valuation so made in discharge of the statutory duty of care is binding upon all persons interested under the trust. (5) Trustees may, in their absolute discretion, from time to time, but not more than once in every year unless the nature of the trust or any special dealings with the trust property make a more frequent exercise of the right reasonable, cause the accounts of the trust property to be examined or audited by an independent accountant, and must, for that purpose, produce such vouchers and give such information to the accountant as the accountant may require. (6) The costs of the examination or audit, including the fee of the auditor, must be paid out of the capital or income of the trust property, or partly in one way and partly in the other as the trustees, in their absolute discretion, think fit, but, in default of any direction by the trustees to the contrary in any special case, costs attributable to capital must be borne by capital and those attributable to income by income. 25.

(2) A delegation under this section — ( a ) commences as provided by the instrument creating the power or, if the instrument makes no provision as to the commencement of the delegation, on the date of the execution of the instrument by the donor; and ( b ) continues for a period of 18 months or any shorter period provided by the instrument creating the power. (3) The persons who may be donees of a power of attorney under this section include a trust corporation. (4) Before or within 7 days after giving a power of attorney under this section, the donor must give written notice of it (specifying the date on which the power comes into operation and its duration, the donee of the power, the reason why the power is given and, where only some trusts, powers and discretions are delegated, the trusts, powers and discretions delegated) to — ( a ) each person (other than the donor), if any, who under any instrument creating the trust has power (whether alone or jointly) to appoint a new trustee; and ( b ) each of the other trustees, if any, but failure to comply with this subsection does not, in favour of a person dealing with the donee of the power, invalidate any act done or instrument executed by the donee. (5) A power of attorney given under this section by a single donor — ( a ) in the form set out in the Third Schedule; or ( b ) in a form to the like effect but expressed to be made under this subsection, operates to delegate to the person, identified in the form as the single donee of the power, the execution and the exercise of all the trusts, powers and discretions vested in the donor as trustee (either alone or jointly with any other person or persons) under the single trust so identified. (6) The donor of a power of attorney given under this section shall be liable for the acts or defaults of the donee in the same manner as if they were the acts or defaults of the donor. (7) For the purpose of executing or exercising the trusts or powers delegated to the donee, the donee may exercise any of the powers conferred on the donor as trustee by statute or by the instrument creating the trust, including power, for the purpose of the transfer of any inscribed stock or securities, for the donee to delegate to an attorney the power to transfer, but not including the power of delegation conferred by this section. (8) The fact that it appears from any power of attorney given under this section, or from any evidence required for the purposes of any such power of attorney or otherwise, that in dealing with any stock or securities the donee of the power is acting in the execution of a trust, is not deemed for any purpose to affect — ( a ) the Depository (as defined in section 81SF of the Securities and Futures Act 2001); ( b ) any person in whose books the stock is inscribed or registered; or ( c ) the issuer of the securities, with any notice of the trust. [36/2014] (9) This section applies to a personal representative as it applies to a trustee except that subsection (4) applies as if it required the notice mentioned in it to be given to each of the other personal representatives (if any) except any executor who has renounced probate.

(2) In deciding whether the whole or any part of the income of the property is during a minority to be paid or applied for the purposes mentioned in subsection (1), the trustees must have regard to the age of the infant and the infant’s requirements and generally to the circumstances of the case, and in particular to what other income (if any) is applicable for the same purposes; and where trustees have notice that the income of more than one fund is applicable for those purposes, then, so far as practicable, unless the entire income of the funds is paid or applied as mentioned in subsection (1) or the court otherwise directs, a proportionate part only of the income of each fund must be so paid or applied. (3) During the infancy of the person, so long as his or her interest continues, the trustees must accumulate all the residue of that income by investing it, and any profits from so investing it, from time to time in authorised investments, and must hold those accumulations as follows: ( a ) if the person — (i) attains 21 years of age, or marries under that age, and his or her interest in the income during his or her infancy or until marriage is a vested interest; or (ii) on attaining 21 years of age, or on marriage under that age, becomes entitled to the property from which the income arose in fee simple, absolute or determinable, or under a grant issued under the State Lands Act 1920 or absolutely, the trustees must hold the accumulations in trust for that person absolutely, and so that the receipt of that person after marriage, and though still an infant, is a good discharge; and ( b ) in any other case the trustees must, even though the person had a vested interest in the income, hold the accumulations as an accretion to the capital of the property from which the accumulations arose, and as one fund with such capital for all purposes, but the trustees may, at any time during the infancy of the person, so long as his or her interest continues, apply all or part of those accumulations as if they were income arising in the then current year. (4) This section applies in the case of a contingent interest only if the limitation or trust carries the intermediate income of the property, but it applies to a future or contingent legacy by the parent of, or a person standing in loco parentis to, the legatee, if and for such period as, under the general law, the legacy carries interest for the maintenance of the legatee, and in the latter case the rate of interest is (if the income available is sufficient and subject to any provision of the Rules of Court to the contrary) 5% per annum. (5) This section applies to a vested annuity in the same manner as if the annuity were the income of property held by trustees in trust to pay the income to the annuitant for the same period for which the annuity is payable, except that in any case accumulations made during the infancy of the annuitant must be held in trust for the annuitant or the annuitant’s personal representatives absolutely.

(4) The power of appointment given by subsection (1) or any similar previous written law to the personal representatives of a last surviving or continuing trustee is and is deemed always to have been exercisable by the executors for the time being (whether original or by representation) of the surviving or continuing trustee who have proved the will of their testator or by the administrators for the time being of such trustee without the concurrence of any executor who has renounced or has not proved. (5) But a sole or last surviving executor intending to renounce, or all the executors where they all intend to renounce, has or have and is or are deemed always to have had power, at any time before renouncing probate, to exercise the power of appointment given by this section, or by any similar previous written law, if willing to act for that purpose and without thereby accepting the office of executor.

(7) It is not obligatory to appoint any additional trustee under subsection (6) unless the instrument (if any) creating the trust, or any written law provides to the contrary, nor is the number of trustees to be increased beyond 4 by virtue of any such appointment. (8) Every new trustee appointed under this section, as well before as after all the trust property becomes by law, or by assurance, or otherwise, vested in the new trustee, has the same powers, authorities and discretions, and may in all respects act as if the new trustee had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument (if any) creating the trust. (9) The provisions of this section relating to a trustee who is dead include the case of a person nominated a trustee in a will but dying before the testator, and those relative to a continuing trustee include a refusing or retiring trustee, if willing to act in the execution of the provisions of this section. (10) Where a trustee lacks capacity (within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2008) to exercise his or her functions as trustee and is also entitled in possession to some beneficial interest in the trust property, no appointment of a new trustee in his or her place is to be made by the continuing trustees or trustee, under this section, unless permission has been given by the court to make the appointment.

(2) Where by a deed a retiring trustee is discharged under the statutory power without a new trustee being appointed, then — ( a ) if the deed contains a declaration as mentioned in subsection (1) by the retiring and continuing trustees, and by the other person (if any) empowered to appoint trustees, the deed operates, without any conveyance or assignment, to vest in the continuing trustees alone, as joint tenants, and for the purposes of the trust, the estate, interest or right to which the declaration relates; and ( b ) if the deed is made on or after 1 September 1929 and does not contain such a declaration, the deed operates, subject to any express provision to the contrary in the deed, as if it had contained such a declaration by such persons as referred to in paragraph ( a ) extending to all the estates, interests and rights with respect to which a declaration could have been made. (3) An express vesting declaration — ( a ) whether made before, on or after 1 September 1929; ( b ) even though the estate, interest or right to be vested is not expressly referred to; and ( c ) provided that the other statutory requirements were or are complied with, operates and is deemed always to have operated (but without prejudice to any express provision to the contrary contained in the deed of appointment or discharge) to vest in the persons respectively referred to in subsections (1) and (2), as the case may require, such estates, interests and rights as are capable of being and ought to be vested in those persons. (4) This section does not extend — ( a ) to land conveyed by way of mortgage for securing money subject to the trust, except land conveyed on trust for securing debentures or debenture stock; ( b ) to land held under a lease which contains any covenant, condition or agreement against assignment or disposing of the land without licence or consent, unless, prior to the execution of the deed containing expressly or impliedly the vesting declaration, the requisite licence or consent has been obtained, or unless by virtue of any written law or rule of law, the vesting declaration, express or implied, would not operate as a breach of covenant or give rise to a forfeiture; or ( c ) to any share, stock, annuity or property which is only transferable in books kept by a company or other body, or in the manner directed by or under any written law. (5) In subsection (4), “lease” includes an underlease and an agreement for a lease or underlease. (6) This section applies to deeds of appointment or discharge executed on or after 1 August 1886."
