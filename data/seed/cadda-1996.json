(3) Where the Minister makes an affirmative final determination under subsection (1), he or she must — ( a ) publish a notice of the affirmative final determination stating the reasons therefor, the countervailing duties applicable and the subject goods on which the countervailing duties apply; ( b ) impose countervailing duties in accordance with section 3(2) on the subject goods imported into Singapore on or after the date of publication of the affirmative final determination; and ( c ) impose countervailing duties in accordance with subsections (5) and (6) on imports into Singapore for which provisional measures were applied. (4) Where an affirmative final determination has been made, the Minister may take into consideration public interest in determining whether to impose countervailing duties and the amount of such duties. (5) The Minister must impose countervailing duties on the subject goods against which provisional measures were applied if the Minister — ( a ) makes a determination of material injury under subsection (1)( b )(i); or ( b ) makes a determination of threat of material injury under subsection (1)( b )(ii) and finds that the import of the subject goods, in the absence of the provisional measures, would have led to a finding of material injury under subsection (1)( b )(i). (6) With respect to the imposition of any countervailing duty under subsection (5) — ( a ) where the countervailing duty is higher than the provisional duty or the amount guaranteed by the security required under the provisional measures, only the amount equal to the provisional duty or the security given is to be imposed; and ( b ) where the countervailing duty is less than the provisional duty or the amount guaranteed by the security required under the provisional measures, the full amount of the countervailing duty is to be imposed and the excess provisional duty paid or security given must be reimbursed or released. (7) Where no countervailing duties are imposed under subsection (5) on the subject goods against which the provisional measures were applied, the Minister must refund the provisional duty paid and release the security required by the provisional measures. (8) Despite subsections (3) and (5), the Minister may impose countervailing duties on the subject goods imported into Singapore within a period of 90 days prior to the application of provisional measures, but in no case earlier than the date of initiation of the investigation, if — ( a ) the Minister finds injury that is difficult to repair; ( b ) such injury is being caused by massive imports of the subject goods in a relatively short period of time and the Minister considers the retroactive imposition of duties necessary to preclude the recurrence of such injury; and ( c ) countervailable subsidies are being provided with respect to the subject goods in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. (9) When a countervailing duty is imposed on the subject goods, such countervailing duty must, as provided in the regulations, be imposed in the appropriate amount on a non‑discriminatory basis on all imports of such goods into Singapore from the country found to be subsidising the subject goods."

(2) Where there are no sales in the domestic market of the exporting country under subsection (1), or where, because of the particular market situation or the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the subject goods is — ( a ) the comparable price actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade for like goods exported to any appropriate third country, provided that such price is representative; or ( b ) the constructed value of the subject goods which must include the cost of production in the exporting country, plus a reasonable amount for profits. (3) For the purpose of subsection (2), sales of like goods destined for consumption in the domestic market of the exporting country or the appropriate third country is normally considered a sufficient quantity for the determination of the normal value if such sales constitute 5% or more of the sales of the subject goods to Singapore, except that a lower ratio is acceptable where the evidence shows that domestic sales at such lower ratio are of sufficient magnitude to provide for a proper comparison. (4) Sales of the like goods in the domestic market of the exporting country or sales to a third country at prices below per unit cost of production may be treated as not being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price and may be disregarded in determining normal value only if the Minister determines that such sales are made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities and are at prices which do not provide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time. (5) For the purpose of determining the cost of production referred to in subsections (2)( b ) and (4), the cost of production must be computed on the basis of all fixed and variable costs of manufacturing for sale in the exporting country plus a reasonable amount for selling, administrative and other general expenses. (6) In the circumstances described in subsection (4), the normal value of any subject goods may be determined on the basis of — ( a ) the remaining sales in the domestic market made at a price which is not less than the cost of production, provided that such remaining sales are in sufficient quantities; or ( b ) where the sale does not exist in sufficient quantities in the domestic market, the remaining sales in the third country market made at a price which is not less than the cost of production, provided that such remaining sales are in sufficient quantities.
