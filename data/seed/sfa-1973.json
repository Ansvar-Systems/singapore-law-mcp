[48/2017] (6) Without affecting section 32, in any proceedings for an offence under section 20 in relation to the publication of an advertisement in contravention of subsection (2), it is a defence to the charge for the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities — ( a ) that — (i) the accused was acting in the course of a business of delivering, transmitting or broadcasting communications (in whatever form or by whatever means) or making data available; and (ii) the nature of the business is such that persons undertaking it have no control over the nature or content of the communications or data; or ( b ) that the accused — (i) carried on the business of publishing or arranging for the publication of advertisements; and (ii) published or arranged for the publication of the advertisement in question in the ordinary course of that business. [48/2017] (7) However, subsection (6) does not apply if the accused concerned — ( a ) ought reasonably to have known that the publication of the advertisement was an offence under this Part; ( b ) had previously been informed in writing by or on behalf of the Director‑General that publication of such an advertisement would constitute an offence under this Part; or ( c ) is the proprietor of a food business or is otherwise engaged in the conduct of a food business for which the advertisements concerned were published.

(9) Despite anything in any regulations made under this section, any person may, at any time within 12 months after the date of the publication in the Gazette of such regulations, sell any food the sale of which is otherwise lawful, if that person proves that at that date the food or food contact article was part of the existing stock-in-trade in Singapore of any person carrying on business there and that since that date no act has been done whereby the food or food contact article fails to conform to the requirements of those regulations. [48/2017] (10) For the purposes of subsection (9) any goods purchased before the date of the publication in the Gazette of such regulations for import into Singapore are deemed to form part of the purchasers’ stock-in-trade in Singapore."
