(9) Any person that contravenes subsection (1), (3), (4), (5), (7) or any condition imposed under subsection (6) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction — ( a ) in the case of an individual, to a fine not exceeding $125,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both; or ( b ) in any other case, to a fine not exceeding $250,000.

(12) This section applies to corrected data received by the approved member from the licensed credit bureau under section 18(3)( b )(ii) as it applies to customer information of any approved member of the licensed credit bureau received by the approved member from the licensed credit bureau."
