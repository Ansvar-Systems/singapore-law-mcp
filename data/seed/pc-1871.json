Illustrations ( a ) A throws a stone at B intending to hurt B (but not intending or not knowing that A is likely to cause wrongful loss or damage in respect of any property), but the stone hits a porcelain vase. A does not commit mischief in respect of the vase. This is because A did not possess the fault element required to commit mischief.

A commits an offence of voluntarily causing hurt against P .

A commits an offence against C of voluntarily causing hurt where grievous hurt is caused under section 323A.

Illustrations ( a ) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. ( b ) A , knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A , not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A , although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. ( c ) A intentionally gives Z a knife-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z ’s death. ( d ) A , without any excuse, fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. When culpable homicide is not murder Exception 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos: ( a ) that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person; ( b ) that the offender did not know and had no reason to believe that the provocation was given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant; ( c ) that the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Explanation 1.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact, having regard to whether an ordinary person of the same gender and age as the offender, sharing such characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation as the offender, would be deprived of self-control by the provocation. Explanation 2.—Grave and sudden provocation may be in the form of words, gestures or conduct or any combination of words, gestures or conduct. Illustrations ( a ) A , under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z , intentionally kills Y , Z ’s child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. ( b ) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A . A , on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y , neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z , who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z . Here A has not committed murder but merely culpable homicide. ( c ) A is lawfully arrested by Z , a police officer. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z . This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. ( d ) A appears as a witness before Z , a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A ’s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z . This is murder. ( e ) A attempts to pull Z ’s nose. Z , in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z . This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. ( f ) Z strikes B . B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A , a bystander, intending to take advantage of B ’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z , puts a knife into B ’s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. ( g ) A and Z are married to each other. A loses self-control on Z ’s provocation and intentionally kills Z soon after the provocation was given. Although the provocation, when viewed in isolation, would not amount to grave and sudden provocation, it was the last of a series of prolonged physical and mental abuse of A by Z . An ordinary person in A ’s position would have lost self-control and have done what A did. A has committed only culpable homicide and not murder. Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law, and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence, without premeditation and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. Explanation .—The word “premeditation” means the offender’s intention, which was formed prior to the circumstances which gave rise to the act of private defence — ( a ) to cause death in section 300( a ) or to cause such bodily injury as is mentioned in section 300( b ) or ( c ); or ( b ) to do an act knowing that the act is so imminently dangerous in the way mentioned in section 300( d ). Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant, or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant, and without ill will towards the person whose death is caused. Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The above exception is subject to the proviso that the offender did not know and had no reason to believe that the person whose death was caused was acting in obedience to the law, or was a public servant acting in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. Explanation 1 .— It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Explanation 2.—The word “fight” includes the exchange of blows even if the blows do not land on their target and includes a single blow or punch. Explanation 3 .—The word “premeditation” means the offender’s intention, which was formed prior to the circumstances constituting the sudden fight — ( a ) to cause death in section 300( a ) or to cause such bodily injury as is mentioned in section 300( b ) or ( c ); or ( b ) to do an act knowing that the act is so imminently dangerous in the way mentioned in section 300( d ). Explanation 4.—A “quarrel” does not require a verbal exchange of words. Illustrations ( a ) A and Z , who are rival gang members, are in a coffee shop seated at different tables. They mutually stare at each other fiercely without exchanging any words. Z disengages from A by turning away and starts to leave the coffee shop. A sees a cutlery knife on his table which A had earlier used for A ’s meal. A picks up the cutlery knife and stabs Z ’s throat in the heat of passion. Z falls and dies almost immediately. Although there was a “sudden quarrel” without any exchange of words, Exception 4 does not apply because there was no “fight”, there being no exchange of blows or assault between A and Z . ( b ) A had a consensual sexual relationship with Z until Z terminated the relationship. A came to Z ’s house and asked Z if Z would have sex with A . Z refused. A became angry and said A would use force, if necessary. A grappled with Z who resisted A ’s advances and struck A ’s face. Enraged by Z ’s resistance, A slams Z into a wall, and Z slumps to the ground. While Z is motionless on the ground, A kicks Z ’s head repeatedly and kills Z . Exception 4 does not apply because A had taken undue advantage of Z while Z was lying motionless on the ground. Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above 18 years of age, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. Illustration A and Z , both being persons above 18 years of age, decide to commit suicide together by drinking poison. With Z ’s consent, A pours a lethal poison down Z ’s throat but after watching Z die, A cannot summon the courage to drink the same poison. A has committed culpable homicide and not murder. Exception 6.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender being a woman voluntarily causes the death of her child being a child below 12 months of age, and at the time of the offence the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child. Exception 7.—Culpable homicide is not murder if at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially — ( a ) impaired the offender’s capacity — (i) to know the nature of the acts or omissions in causing the death or in being a party to causing the death; or (ii) to know whether such acts or omissions are wrong; or [Act 23 of 2021 wef 01/03/2022] ( b ) impaired the offender’s power to control his acts or omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death. Paragraph ( a )(ii) of the above exception applies only if, at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, there was a substantial impairment of the offender’s capacity to know that the acts or omissions — ( a ) are wrong by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest persons; and ( b ) are wrong as contrary to law.

Explanation .—An act has a legitimate purpose related to art which reasonable persons would regard as art. Illustrations ( a ) A university researcher has child abuse material in his possession for the purposes of studying the psychological effects of exposure to such material. The researcher’s possession of the child abuse material has a legitimate purpose. ( b ) A is a photo-journalist in a war zone.

Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft. Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. Explanation 2.—A moving, effected by the same act which effects the severance, may be a theft. Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving, or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which in consequence of the motion so caused is moved by that animal. Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied. Explanation 6.—A person may move property which is intangible or incorporeal by transferring the property from one account to another account or transferring the interests in the property from one person to another person or by extinguishing the property. Illustrations ( a ) A cuts down a tree on Z ’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z ’s possession without Z ’s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree, in order to such taking, he has committed theft. ( b ) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z ’s dog to follow it. Here, if A ’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z ’s possession without Z’s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z ’s dog has begun to follow A . ( c ) [ Deleted by Act 51 of 2007 ] ( d ) A , being Z ’s servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z ’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate without Z ’s consent. A has committed theft. ( e ) Z , going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A , the owner or operator of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z ’s possession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z ’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. [Act 23 of 2021 wef 01/03/2022] ( f ) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z ’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. ( g ) A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person. A by taking it commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. ( h ) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z ’s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z , with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A , at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. ( i ) A delivers his watch to Z , a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A , not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z ’s hand, and carries it away. Here A , though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly. ( j ) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z ’s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. ( k ) Again, if A having pawned his watch to Z , takes it out of Z ’s possession without Z ’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. ( l ) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z ’s possession, without Z ’s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft. ( m ) A , being on friendly terms with Z , goes into Z ’s library in Z ’s absence and takes away a book, without Z ’s express consent, for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z ’s implied consent to use Z ’s book. If this was A ’s impression, A has not committed theft. ( n ) A asks charity from Z ’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z , her husband. Here, it is probable that A may conceive that Z ’s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A ’s impression, A has not committed theft. ( o ) A is the paramour of Z ’s wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z , and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. ( p ) A in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A ’s own property, takes that property out of B ’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. ( q ) A gains access to Z ’s bank account and dishonestly transfers money from Z ’s account to A ’s own account without Z ’s knowledge or consent. A commits theft. [15/2019]"

When theft is robbery (2) Theft is “robbery” if, in order to commit theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. When extortion is robbery (3) Extortion is “robbery” if the offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted. Explanation. —The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. Illustrations ( a ) A holds Z down, and dishonestly takes Z ’s money and jewels from Z ’s clothes, without Z ’s consent. Here A has committed theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z . A has therefore committed robbery. ( b ) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z ’s purse. Z , in consequence surrenders his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z , by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. A has therefore committed robbery. ( c ) A meets Z and Z ’s child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to fling it down a precipice, unless Z delivers his purse. Z , in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z , by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child, Z being present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z . ( d ) A obtains property from Z by saying, “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us $1,000.” This is extortion, and punishable as such; but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child."

Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both. Illustrations ( a ) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z ’s possession in good faith believing, at the time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A , after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. ( b ) A , being on friendly terms with Z , goes into Z ’s house in Z ’s absence and takes away a book without Z ’s express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z ’s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. ( c ) A and B being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B ’s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the meaning of this section. Illustration A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z , bearing a blank endorsement. A , knowing that the note belongs to Z , pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z . A has committed an offence under this section. Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to the owner, does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner, and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. What are reasonable means, or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact. It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found. Illustrations ( a ) A finds a dollar on the high road, not knowing to whom the dollar belongs. A picks up the dollar. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this section. ( b ) A finds a letter on the high road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section. ( c ) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of the person who has drawn the cheque appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. ( d ) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z , but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. ( e ) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z , and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. ( f ) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.

[15/2019] (2) To avoid doubt, where a person alleges a mistake of fact or ignorance of a fact that may negate the fault element of the offence that the person is charged with, the prosecution must prove the fault element in order to establish liability under the offence. Explanation 1 .—Where the physical and fault elements of an offence are proven, and the accused person proves the defence under subsection (1), the accused person is not guilty of that offence. Explanation 2 .—Where an alleged mistake of fact or ignorance of a fact may negate the fault element of an offence, the accused person does not need to rely on the defence of mistake. The accused person may allege the mistake of fact or ignorance of the fact for the purpose of raising a reasonable doubt that the accused person had the requisite fault element as a result of labouring under the mistake of fact or ignorance of fact. The prosecution must prove the fault element in order to establish liability under the offence. Illustrations ( a ) A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A , in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the act, seizes Z , in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence.

As A approaches Z , Z suddenly shouts aloud that he is carrying a bomb and warns A not to approach further. As A draws his revolver, Z suddenly starts to run away. A , after assessing the circumstances of the case, and to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, believes that Z has a bomb and will set it off. A shoots Z and Z dies as a result. A has committed no offence, even though it may turn out that Z was not carrying a bomb. ( c ) A , a police officer, is deployed to perform patrol duty at an underground train station. A receives information from police headquarters that someone is attempting to plant a bomb in the public transport system. The profile of the suspect is also provided. While patrolling the underground train station, A sees Z , who fits the profile. Z is seen carrying a backpack and behaving suspiciously. A approaches Z and orders him to stop. Z suddenly starts running towards a crowd in the station. A , after assessing the circumstances of the case, and to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, believes that Z has a bomb and will set it off. A shoots Z and Z dies as a result. A has committed no offence, even though it may turn out that Z was not carrying a bomb. ( d ) X , the commander of a naval vessel, is patrolling Singapore territorial waters. X receives information that someone may hijack a vessel in order to commit a terrorist act. X spots vessel A which is proceeding at high speed towards a cruise liner. X orders vessel A to stop her manoeuvre immediately and fires a warning signal. Vessel A instead starts accelerating towards the cruise liner. X , after assessing the circumstances of the case, and to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, believes that vessel A is going to ram into the cruise liner. X gives an order to fire at vessel A . The persons on board vessel A die as a result. X has committed no offence, even though it may turn out that vessel A was not hijacked nor were there any terrorist on board. ( e ) A , an officer of a court, being ordered by that court to arrest Y , and, after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y , arrests Z . A has committed no offence. ( f ) A sees a watch on Z ’s desk, which is identical to one that A owns, and mistakenly believes the watch is actually his. A intentionally takes the watch out of Z ’s possession without Z ’s consent while labouring under such mistaken belief.

Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. Explanation.— It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm. Illustrations ( a ) A , the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B , with 20 or 30 passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course he must incur risk of running down a boat C , with only 2 passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C , and in good faith for the purposes of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B , he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C , by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat C . ( b ) A in a great fire pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention, in good faith, of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A ’s act, A is not guilty of the offence. ( c ) X , the commander of a naval vessel, is deployed in response to a threat of a terrorist attack against a ferry terminal in Singapore. X receives information that vessel A , with a crew of 6, has been hijacked by terrorists and is approaching the ferry terminal at great speed and is likely to collide into the terminal. There is insufficient time to evacuate the persons at the terminal, which is estimated to be about 100. X orders vessel A to stop her manoeuvre immediately and fires a warning signal. However, vessel A continues her advance towards the terminal. Here, if X gives an order to fire at vessel A to disable it, without any intention to cause harm to the crew members of vessel A , and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the persons at the terminal, he is not guilty of an offence. This is so even though he knows that he is likely to cause harm to the crew members of vessel A , if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which X intends to avoid is such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of firing at vessel A .

Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person or any other person will otherwise be the consequence: Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint. Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins gang-robbers knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. Explanation 2.—A person seized by gang-robbers, and forced by threat of instant death to do a thing which is an offence by law — for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of a house for the gang‑robbers to enter and plunder it — is entitled to the benefit of this exception."

      "content": "464. —(1) A person is said to make a false document or false electronic record — ( a ) who dishonestly or fraudulently — (i) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document; (ii) makes any electronic record or part of any electronic record; (iii) affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record; or (iv) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the electronic signature, with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or electronic record or part of a document or electronic record or electronic signature was made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed, or at a time at which he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed; ( b ) who without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof, after it has been made, executed or affixed with an electronic signature, either by himself or by any other person, whether that person is living or dead at the time of the alteration; or ( c ) who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on an electronic record, knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practised upon him he does not, know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the alteration. (2) In this section, “electronic signature” has the same meaning as in the Electronic Transactions Act 2010. Illustrations ( a ) A has a letter of credit upon B for $1,000 written by Z . A , in order to defraud B , adds a cypher to the 1,000, and makes the sum $10,000, intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery. ( b ) A , without Z ’s authority, affixes Z ’s seal to a document, purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A , with the intention of selling the estate to B , and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase money. A has committed forgery. ( c ) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B , payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of $1,000. A commits forgery. ( d ) A leaves with B , his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A , without inserting the sum payable, and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding $1,000 for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of $10,000. B commits forgery. ( e ) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B ’s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker, and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B , and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. ( f ) Z ’s will contains these words: “I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A , B and C ”. A dishonestly scratches out B ’s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C . A has committed forgery. ( g ) A endorses a promissory note and makes it payable to Z , or his order, by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z , or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. ( h ) A sells and conveys an estate to Z . A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B , dated 6 months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z , intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z . A has committed forgery. ( i ) Z dictates his will to A . A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z , and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. ( j ) A writes a letter and signs it with B ’s name without B ’s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. ( k ) A without B ’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B ’s name, certifying to A ’s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z . A has committed forgery, inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. Illustrations ( a ) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery. ( b ) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z ’s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z , and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z . A is guilty of forgery; and if B knowing the fact draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A ’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. ( c ) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable: here A has committed forgery. ( d ) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B . B after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z , executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period, and dates the lease 6 months prior to the seizure with intent to defraud A , and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B , though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. ( e ) A , a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A ’s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors, and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. Illustration A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery."

Imputation of any truth which the public good requires to be made or published First Exception.— It is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it is for the public good that the imputation should be made or published. Whether or not it is for the public good is a question of fact. Public conduct of public servants Second Exception. —It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of any person touching any discharge of his public functions, or respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further. Conduct of any person touching any public question Third Exception .—It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of any person touching any public question, and respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further. Illustration It is not defamation in A to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting Z ’s conduct in petitioning Government on a public question, in signing a requisition for a meeting on a public question, in presiding or attending at such a meeting, in forming or joining any society which invites the public support, in voting or canvassing for a particular candidate for any situation in the efficient discharge of the duties in which the public is interested. Publication of reports of proceedings of courts of justice, etc. Fourth Exception.— It is not defamation to publish a substantially true report of the proceedings of a court of justice, or of Parliament, or of the result of any such proceedings. Explanation.— A Magistrate or other officer holding an inquiry in open court preliminary to a trial in a court of justice, is a court within the meaning of the above section. Merits of case decided in a court of justice; or conduct of witnesses and others concerned therein Fifth Exception.— It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the merits of any case, civil or criminal, which has been decided by a court of justice, or respecting the conduct of any person as a party, a witness or an agent, in any such case, or respecting the character of such person, as far as his character appears in that conduct, and no further. Illustrations ( a ) A says, “I think Z ’s evidence on that trial is so contradictory that he must be stupid or dishonest”. A is within this exception if he says this in good faith, inasmuch as the opinion which he expresses respects Z ’s character as it appears in Z ’s conduct as a witness, and no further. ( b ) But if A says, “I do not believe what Z asserted at that trial, because I know him to be a man without veracity”, A is not within this exception, inasmuch as the opinion which he expresses of Z ’s character is an opinion not founded on Z ’s conduct as a witness. Merits of a public performance Sixth Exception .—It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion respecting the merits of any performance which its author has submitted to the judgment of the public, or respecting the character of the author so far as his character appears in such performance, and no further. Explanation .—A performance may be submitted to the judgment of the public expressly or by acts on the part of the author which imply such submission to the judgment of the public. Illustrations ( a ) A person who publishes a book, submits that book to the judgment of the public. ( b ) A person who makes a speech in public, submits that speech to the judgment of the public. ( c ) An actor or a singer who appears on a public stage, submits his acting or singing to the judgment of the public. ( d ) A says of a book published by Z , “ Z ’s book is foolish, Z must be a weak man. Z ’s book is indecent, Z must be a man of impure mind”. A is within this exception, if he says this in good faith, inasmuch as the opinion which he expresses of Z respects Z ’s character only so far as it appears in Z ’s book, and no further. ( e ) But if A says, “I am not surprised that Z ’s book is foolish and indecent, for he is a weak man and a libertine”, A is not within this exception, inasmuch as the opinion which he expresses of Z ’s character is an opinion not founded on Z ’s book. Censure passed in good faith by a person having lawful authority over another Seventh Exception .—It is not defamation in a person having over another any authority, either conferred by law, or arising out of a lawful contract made with that other, to pass in good faith any censure on the conduct of that other in matters to which such lawful authority relates. Illustration A judge censuring in good faith the conduct of a witness or of an officer of the court; a head of a department censuring in good faith those who are under his orders; a parent censuring in good faith a child in the presence of other children; a schoolmaster, whose authority is derived from a parent, censuring in good faith a pupil in the presence of other pupils; a master censuring a servant in good faith for remissness in service; a banker censuring in good faith the cashier of his bank for his conduct as such cashier — are within this exception. Accusation preferred in good faith to a duly authorised person Eighth Exception .—It is not defamation to prefer in good faith an accusation against any person to any of those who have lawful authority over that person with respect to the subject matter of the accusation. Illustration If A in good faith accuses Z before a Magistrate; if A in good faith complains of the conduct of Z , a servant, to Z ’s master; if A in good faith complains of the conduct of Z , a child, to Z ’s father — A is within this exception. Imputation made in good faith by a person for the protection of his interests Ninth Exception .—It is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of another, provided that the imputation is made in good faith for the protection of the interests of the person making it, or of any other person, or for the public good. Illustrations ( a ) A , a shopkeeper, says to B , who manages his business, “Sell nothing to Z unless he pays you ready money, for I have no opinion of his honesty”. A is within the exception, if he has made this imputation on Z in good faith for the protection of his own interests. ( b ) A , a Magistrate, in making a report to his superior officer, casts an imputation on the character of Z . Here, if the imputation is made in good faith and for the public good, A is within the exception. Caution intended for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed or for the public good Tenth Exception .—It is not defamation to convey a caution, in good faith, to one person against another, provided that the caution is intended for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed, or of some person in whom that person is interested, or for the public good. Explanation to Exceptions In proving the existence of circumstances as a defence under the Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth or Tenth exception, good faith shall be presumed unless the contrary appears."

[15/2019] (3) A person may attempt the doing of a thing despite the existence of facts of which he is unaware which make the doing of the thing impossible. Illustrations ( a ) A makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open a box, and finds after so opening the box that there is no jewel in it. He has taken a substantial step towards the commission of theft, and therefore is guilty of attempted theft. ( b ) A makes an attempt to pick the pocket of Z by thrusting his hand into Z ’s pocket. A fails in the attempt in consequence of Z ’s having nothing in his pocket. A is guilty of attempted theft even though it was not possible for A to steal any thing from Z ’s empty pocket. ( c ) When Z is not looking, A opens Z ’s bag and takes away an electronic device with the intention of stealing it from Z . A genuinely believes that the electronic device belongs to Z but it in fact belongs to A , who had previously lent it to Z . A is guilty of attempted theft even though it was not possible for A to have committed theft of A ’s own device. ( d ) A and Z are friends who share a room in which Z keeps a personal safe with a combination lock. A peeps at Z opening the safe in order to memorise the combination code to the safe. When Z is out of the room, A attempts to remember the code to unlock Z ’s safe with the intention of stealing the cash in the safe. A tries several times but is unable to remember the code correctly before Z returns. A is guilty of an offence of attempted theft even though he could not have opened the safe because of his inept memory of the code. [15/2019]"

Illustration A attempts to commit kidnapping of B in order that B may be murdered but did not succeed. If A had committed kidnapping in order to murder, he would have been punished with death or imprisonment for life (and would, if not sentenced to death, also be liable to caning). A shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

As the court is not bound to impose the minimum mandatory punishment prescribed for robbery, A may be sentenced to 6 months imprisonment with no caning for attempted robbery.

      "content": "107. —(1) A person abets the doing of a thing who — ( a ) instigates any person to do that thing; ( b ) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or ( c ) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. [15/2019] (2) A person may abet the doing of a thing despite the existence of facts of which he is unaware which make the doing of the thing impossible. Explanation 1.—A person who, by intentional misrepresentation, or by intentional concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. Illustration A , a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a court of justice to apprehend Z . B , knowing that fact and also that C is not Z , intentionally represents to A that C is Z , and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C . Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C . Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.

      "content": "108. A person abets an offence who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence, although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. Illustrations ( a ) A instigates B to murder C . B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. ( b ) A instigates B to murder D . B , in pursuance of the instigation, stabs D . D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. Illustrations ( a ) A , with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an act which would be an offence if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A . Here A , whether the act is committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence. ( b ) A , with the intention of murdering Z , instigates B , a child below 7 years of age, to do an act which causes Z ’s death. B , in consequence of the abetment, does the act, and thereby causes Z ’s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. ( c ) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling house. B , in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A ’s instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence. ( d ) A , intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z ’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A . B takes the property out of Z ’s possession, in good faith believing it to be A ’s property. B , acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence. Illustration A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z . B accordingly instigates C to murder Z , and C commits that offence in consequence of B ’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and as A instigated B to commit the offence A is also liable to the same punishment. Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. Illustration A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z . It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C , mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A ’s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section, and is liable to the punishment for murder."

Illustrations ( a ) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z , and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y , which is by the side of that of Z . Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A ’s instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y . ( b ) A instigates B to burn Z ’s house. B sets fire to the house, and at the same time commits theft of property there. A , though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning.
