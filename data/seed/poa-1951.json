[7/89; 37/93] (2) A probation order may in addition require the offender to comply during the whole or any part of the probation period with such requirements as the court, having regard to the circumstances of the case, considers necessary for securing the good conduct of the offender or for preventing a repetition by him of the same offence or the commission of other offences: Provided that (without prejudice to the power of the court to make an order under section 10(2)) the payment of sums by way of damages for injury or compensation for loss shall not be included among the requirements of a probation order. (3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), a probation order may include — ( a ) requirements relating to the residence of the offender; or ( b ) a requirement that the offender performs such unpaid community service under the supervision of a community service officer. [15/2010] (4) Before making a probation order containing any such requirements referred to in subsection (3)( a ), the court shall consider the home surroundings of the offender; and where the order requires the offender to reside in an approved institution, the name of the institution and the period for which he is so required to reside shall be specified in the order, and that period shall not extend beyond 12 months from the date of the order. [15/2010] (5) A court shall only include the requirement referred to in subsection (3)( b ) if it is satisfied that — ( a ) based on the mental and physical condition of the offender, the offender is a suitable person to perform community service of a type which is specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code 2010; and ( b ) suitable arrangements can be made for him to perform such community service. [15/2010] (6) A court must, before including the requirement referred to in subsection (3)( b ), call for a report from a community service officer regarding the suitability of the offender to perform community service. [15/2010] (7) The number of hours which an offender has to perform community service shall be specified in the probation order and shall not exceed the prescribed maximum hours of community service which an offender may be required to perform community service under a community service order referred to in section 346 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010. [15/2010] (8) If a probation order in relation to an offender requires an offender to perform community service, it shall also be a requirement of the probation order that the offender complies with the obligations referred to in section 347 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 as if he were a person in respect of whom a community service order is made under section 346 of that Code. [15/2010] (9) Before making a probation order, the court shall explain to the offender in ordinary language the effect of the order (including any additional requirements proposed to be inserted therein under subsection (2) or (3)) and that if he fails to comply therewith or commits another offence he will be liable to be sentenced for the original offence; and if the offender is not less than 18 years of age the court shall not make the order unless he expresses his willingness to comply with the requirements thereof. [Act 30 of 2019 wef 30/12/2025] (10) Where a woman or girl is placed under the supervision of a probation officer or volunteer probation officer, the probation officer or volunteer probation officer, as the case may be, shall be a woman. (11) The court by which a probation order is made under this section shall forthwith give copies of the order to the Chief Probation Officer who shall give a copy thereof to — ( a ) the probationer; ( b ) the probation officer or volunteer probation officer who is to be responsible for the supervision of the probationer; and ( c ) the person in charge of any institution in which the probationer is required by the order to reside."

(3) Where the court proposes to amend a probation order under this section, otherwise than on the application of the probationer, it shall summon him to appear before the court, and if the probationer is not less than 18 years of age, the court shall not amend a probation order unless the probationer expresses his willingness to comply with the requirements of the order as amended: Provided that this subsection shall not apply to an order cancelling a requirement of the probation order or reducing the period of any requirement. [Act 30 of 2019 wef 30/12/2025] (4) Where a court discharges or amends a probation order under this section, the clerk to the court shall forthwith give copies of the discharging or amending order to the Chief Probation Officer who shall give a copy thereof to — ( a ) the probationer; ( b ) the probation officer or volunteer probation officer responsible for the supervision of the offender; and ( c ) the person in charge of any institution in which the probationer was required by the probation order as originally made or is required by the amending order to reside. (5) A volunteer probation officer shall not make an application for the discharge or an amendment of a probation order under subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, without the prior approval of the Chief Probation Officer. (6) Where a probation order, whether as originally made under section 5 or as amended under this section, requires a probationer to reside in an approved institution for a period extending beyond 6 months from the date of the order as originally made or amended, as the case may be, the probation officer or volunteer probation officer who is responsible for the supervision of the probationer shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of 6 months from that date, report to the court on the case. (7) On receipt of any such report, the court shall review the probation order for the purpose of considering whether to cancel the requirement as to residence or reduce the period thereof, and may, if it thinks fit, amend the order accordingly without the necessity for any application in that behalf. (8) Where, under the following provisions of this Act, a probationer is sentenced for the offence for which he was placed on probation, the probation order shall cease to have effect."
