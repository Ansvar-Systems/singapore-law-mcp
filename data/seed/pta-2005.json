(10) Where, in any case referred to in subsection (9), the court is satisfied that the person in default has shown sufficient cause for his or her default in not complying with any notice mentioned in subsection (1), the costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioner in exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (4) may, even though the notice has not been issued to the occupier of the premises, be recoverable by the Board from the occupier in the manner provided for in this Act."
