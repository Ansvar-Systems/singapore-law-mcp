(3) To avoid doubt, the court may dispense with the consent of any relevant person under subsection (1) even if the relevant person has made suitable initial arrangements for the child by placing the child under the care of another person or in a home for children and young persons, whether pursuant to a court order or voluntary care agreement under the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 or otherwise.
