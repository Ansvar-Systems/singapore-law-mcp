[15/2002; 21/2012] (2) The reference to service in Parliament in the definition of “reckonable service” in subsection (1) is to be read as including a reference to service in the Legislative Assembly on and after 3 June 1959 and before 9 August 1965. (3) Where a Speaker is not, or has not been, an elected Member of Parliament for any period, “salary” means, for that period, the salary payable to him or her in respect of his or her service as Speaker. (4) Despite any other provision of this Act, where for any period a person who is eligible for any pension or other benefit under this Act voluntarily refrains from receiving the whole or any part of any salary due to the person in respect of the office held by him or her, then, in calculating his or her pension or benefit he or she is, for such period, deemed to have received the full salary to which he or she was entitled as holder of that office."

(2) The option mentioned in subsection (1) is exercisable — ( a ) separately in respect of reckonable service as a Member and as a holder of any office; and ( b ) not later than 30 days after the date when the person becomes eligible for the grant of a pension under this Act, except that if the person has not exercised an option within that time, the President may, if it appears in the circumstances equitable to do so, allow the person to exercise the option at any time prior to the date of payment of a pension or gratuity to the person. (3) Where a person fails to exercise the option in accordance with this section, the person is deemed to have opted to receive a commuted pension gratuity without any pension in respect of his or her reckonable service as a Member or as a holder of an office or both, as the case may be. (4) The option, once exercised by a person in respect of his or her reckonable service as a Member or as a holder of any office (as the case may be), must not be revoked so far as concerns any pension or gratuity so granted to the person under this Act in respect of such period of service prior to the exercise of the option. (5) Subject to this section, the commuted pension gratuity mentioned in subsection (1) is a capital sum ascertained by multiplying the prescribed commutation factor by the amount of pension that the person concerned is eligible for under this Act. (6) Where any pension granted to a person under this Act is required to be re‑computed by adding his or her further reckonable service as a Member or as a holder of any office to any period of reckonable service previously used in computing his or her pension, the commuted pension gratuity must be reduced by such amount of pension or gratuity already received by the person in respect of the period of reckonable service previously used in computing his or her pension. [21/2012] (7) Any commuted pension gratuity to be granted to a person must be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act in force at the date when the person becomes eligible for the grant of a pension under this Act, and must be paid in the prescribed manner. (8) This section does not apply to any person who before 1 January 1995 has been granted and paid a pension or gratuity under the provisions of this Act as in force before that date. (9) Where the person is, on 1 January 1995, an office‑holding Member who — ( a ) has already been granted a pension in respect of any period of his or her reckonable service in an office; and ( b ) on his or her ceasing to hold office, will be eligible to have his or her pension re‑computed with the addition of his or her further period of reckonable service as an office‑holding Member, this section remains applicable to the person but only in respect of that further period of reckonable service as an office‑holding Member."

(2) If any person to whom a pension has been granted under this Act is adjudged a bankrupt or is declared insolvent by judgment of any such court, then such pension forthwith ceases.
