[32/2018] (5) At any time when an aircraft is in flight, any air marshal on board the aircraft may, without being authorised by the commander, take any measures mentioned in subsection (2) against any person on board the aircraft which the air marshal has reasonable grounds to believe are immediately necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft, or of persons on board the aircraft from — ( a ) any act of unlawful interference; or ( b ) the commission of any serious offence.

(9) The commander of an aircraft — ( a ) if he or she disembarks any person pursuant to subsection (8)( a ), in the case of a Singapore-controlled aircraft, in any country or, in the case of any other aircraft, in Singapore, must report the fact of, and the reasons for, that disembarkation to — (i) an appropriate authority in the country of disembarkation; and (ii) the appropriate diplomatic or consular office of the country of nationality of that person; ( b ) if he or she intends to deliver any person in accordance with subsection (8)( b ) in Singapore or, in the case of a Singapore-controlled aircraft, in any other country which is a Convention country, must before or as soon as reasonably practicable after landing give notification of his or her intention and of the reasons therefor — (i) where the country in question is Singapore, to a police officer or immigration officer or, in the case of any other country, to an officer having functions corresponding to the functions either of a police officer or of an immigration officer in Singapore; and (ii) in either case to the appropriate diplomatic or consular office of the country of nationality of that person, and any commander of an aircraft who without reasonable cause fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000.
