(3) Where a person is charged with an offence under section 3 in respect of the discharge of an oily mixture from a place on land, it is (without affecting any other defence under this section) a defence to prove — ( a ) that the oil was contained in an effluent produced by operations for the refining of oil; ( b ) that it was not reasonably practicable to dispose of the effluent otherwise than by discharging it into Singapore waters; and ( c ) that all reasonably practicable steps had been taken for eliminating oil from the effluent.

(5) Where any oil or oily mixture is discharged in consequence of the removal of sunk, stranded or abandoned ships by the Authority in exercise of any power conferred by any written law, and apart from this subsection the Authority or a person employed by or acting on behalf of the Authority would be guilty of an offence under section 3 in respect of that discharge, the Authority or person shall not be convicted of that offence unless it is shown that the Authority or that person failed to take such steps (if any) as were reasonable in the circumstances for preventing, stopping or reducing the discharge."
