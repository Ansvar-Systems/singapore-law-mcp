Illustration 1. A maintenance order was made against R , requiring R to pay a monthly sum of $1,000 to A , for the maintenance of R ’s child, on the first day of every month. 2. R fails to pay any maintenance between 1 February and 1 June (both dates inclusive) which amounts to $5,000 (being 5 months of the monthly sum of $1,000 required to be paid under the maintenance order). A makes a maintenance enforcement application under section 80 on 5 June. 3. R also fails to pay the maintenance that is required under the maintenance order to be paid on 1 July. 4. On 15 July, the court hearing the maintenance enforcement application makes the following orders: ( a ) an order under section 81(2)( a ), declaring that the maintenance arrears owed by R is $6,000 (being the sum of $5,000 for maintenance arrears as at the date of the maintenance enforcement application and $1,000 which is the maintenance required to be paid on 1 July) as at the date of the declaration; ( b ) an order under section 81(1)( a ) read with section 91B(1)( b ), imposing a term of imprisonment of 2 months for R ’s breach of the maintenance order by failing to pay maintenance arrears of $5,000 as at the time the maintenance enforcement application is made; ( c ) an order under section 81(2)( b ), requiring R to pay the arrears of $6,000 in 2 monthly instalments of $3,000 each by 1 August and 1 September (which is in addition to the payable maintenance of $1,000 per month required to be paid under the maintenance order on 1 August and 1 September); ( d ) an order under section 81(2)( c ), requiring R to prove to the court on 4 August and 4 September that R has made payment in accordance with the order under section 81(2)( b ) and payment of payable maintenance under the maintenance order; ( e ) an order under section 81(2)( d ), specifying a term of imprisonment for the purposes of section 91O if R fails to prove payment in accordance with the order under section 81(2)( c ). 5. On 4 August, R proves to the court that R has made payment of $4,000 on 1 August (being the sum of one instalment of $3,000 and the payable maintenance required to be paid under the maintenance order on 1 August). 6. On 4 September, R fails to prove to the court that R has made payment of $4,000 on 1 September (being the sum of one instalment of $3,000 and the payable maintenance required to be paid under the maintenance order on 1 September). R fails to show good cause for failing to prove the payment. Pursuant to section 91O, the court orders R to serve the term of imprisonment specified in the order under section 81(2)( d ) made on 15 July for failing on 4 September to prove payment of the arrears of $3,000, and the term of imprisonment specified in that order under section 81(2)( d ) for failing on 4 September to prove payment of the payable maintenance of $1,000. 7. After R is sentenced to imprisonment for R ’s failure on 4 September to prove payment, R continues to fail to pay any maintenance for which R had been so sentenced. R also fails to pay any maintenance of $1,000 required to be paid under the maintenance order on 1 October, 1 November and 1 December. 8. On 3 December, A makes a second maintenance enforcement application against R for R ’s failure to pay the following sums: ( a ) $4,000 (comprising the maintenance arrears of $3,000 required to be paid by 1 September under the order made under section 81(2)( b ) on 15 July and the maintenance of $1,000 required to be paid by 1 September under the maintenance order) (called previous arrears); ( b ) $3,000 (comprising the maintenance required to be paid under the maintenance order on 1 October, 1 November and 1 December) (called fresh arrears). 9. The court may sentence R to imprisonment under section 81(1)( a ) read with section 91B(1)( b ) for the previous arrears and fresh arrears pursuant to this second maintenance enforcement application.

(6) Where under any order made under this section one party is or may become liable to pay to the other party a sum of money, the court may direct that it must be paid either in one sum or in instalments, and either with or without security, and otherwise in such manner and subject to such conditions (including a condition requiring the payment of interest) as the court thinks fit.
