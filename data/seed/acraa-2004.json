(7) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar under section 30C(2) may, within 30 days after the date of receiving the notice under subsection (5), appeal to the Court which may confirm or reverse the Registrar’s decision and make any directions in the matter. (8) The individual is not allowed to provide a contact address within 3 years after the Registrar causes the individual’s residential address to cease to be excluded from public disclosure, unless the Registrar is satisfied that there is good cause for allowing the individual to do so in a particular case.
