(6) The ownership of anything is not to be taken to be affected by reason only that it is placed in, or affixed to, any land pursuant to such an order; and, subject to subsection (8), so long as any such order in respect of an aerodrome is in force, a person must not, except with the consent of the proprietor of the aerodrome, wilfully interfere with any works or things which to the knowledge of that person, are works or things executed or placed in, on or over any land pursuant to the order. (7) If any person contravenes any of the provisions of subsection (6), the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. (8) Nothing in this section operates, in relation to any structure, so as to restrict the doing of any work for the purpose of repairing, altering, demolishing or removing the structure if — ( a ) notice of the doing of that work is given as soon as possible to the proprietor of the aerodrome; and ( b ) the giving of warning of the presence of the structure in the manner provided by any order made under this section in force in relation thereto is not interrupted.

[16/2015; 34/2019] (5) A Magistrate may, on an application by the Authority, make an order authorising the Authority to destroy or otherwise dispose of any thing seized under subsection (2)( c ) by a safety inspector, if the Magistrate is satisfied that — ( a ) apart from this section, a safety inspector or the Authority is required to return the thing to a person; and ( b ) the safety inspector or the Authority cannot, despite making reasonable efforts, locate the person or the person has refused to take possession of that thing. [16/2015] (6) In this section, “evidential material” means any thing that is relevant to proving a contravention of any provision of this Act or any aviation safety subsidiary legislation (whether or not an offence). [16/2015] (7) In this section, an authorised person is — ( a ) a police officer, or an auxiliary police officer, of or above the rank of sergeant and authorised by the Commissioner of Police to exercise powers under this section; ( b ) a member of the Singapore Armed Forces who is authorised by the Chief of Defence Force to exercise powers under this section; ( c ) a safety inspector authorised by the Authority to exercise powers under this section; or ( d ) an individual with the suitable qualifications and experience to properly exercise one or more of the powers in subsection (2) and authorised by the Authority to do so.
