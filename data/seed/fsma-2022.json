(8) Upon making a determination, the Authority must submit the determination to the Minister for approval. (9) Before approving the determination, the Minister must, unless the Minister decides that it is not practicable or desirable to do so — ( a ) publish in the Gazette and in such newspaper or newspapers as the Minister may determine a notice of the Minister’s intention to approve the determination, specifying such particulars as the Minister considers appropriate; and ( b ) cause to be given to the transferor written notice of the Minister’s intention to approve the determination, specifying such particulars as the Minister considers appropriate and the date by which the transferor may make written representations to the Minister.

(14) Any approval under subsection (13) is subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine to give effect to the determination, and the Minister may add to, vary or revoke any such condition. (15) The transferor or transferee (as the case may be) must comply with every condition mentioned in subsection (14) that applies to it and of which it has been given written notice by the Authority. (16) A person that contravenes subsection (15) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $250,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $25,000 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.
