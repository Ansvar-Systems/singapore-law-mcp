(1A) Despite subsection (1), the court may at any stage of the proceedings, instead of releasing the accused on bail, release the accused on his or her own personal bond if — ( a ) the non-bailable offence for which the accused is being released on personal bond is an offence punishable with imprisonment for not more than 7 years; and ( b ) the prosecution consents to the release of the accused on personal bond.

(3) Despite subsection (2), if there are grounds for further investigations as to whether the accused has committed some other bailable offence, then, pending the investigations, the accused must be released on bail or, at the discretion of the police officer or court, on his or her own personal bond.

[19/2018] (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the offences are as follows: ( a ) any offence under section 403, 404, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 412, 413 or 414 of the Penal Code 1871; ( b ) any offence under section 50, 51, 53, 54 or 55A of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992; ( c ) any other offence (being an offence involving property) that is prescribed.

Illustrations ( a ) A is charged under section 465 of the Penal Code 1871 with committing forgery by making a false document. By virtue of section 463 of that Code, A ’s conduct in making the false document is conduct that is an element of the offence that A is charged with. ( b ) A is charged under section 325 of the Penal Code 1871 with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B . A ’s conduct in causing grievous hurt to B is conduct that is an element of the offence that A is charged with. ( c ) A is charged under section 426 of the Penal Code 1871 with committing mischief by setting fire to a dustbin, and thereby causing the destruction of the dustbin. By virtue of section 425 of that Code, the destruction of the dustbin is an outcome (caused by A ’s conduct of setting fire to the dustbin) that is an element of the offence that A is charged with. ( d ) A is charged under section 417 of the Penal Code 1871 with cheating B by deceiving B , and thereby intentionally inducing B to do a thing which B would not do if B were not so deceived. By virtue of section 415 of that Code, the thing that B is induced to do is an outcome (caused by A ’s conduct of deceiving B ) that is an element of the offence that A is charged with. [19/2018] (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), 2 or more alleged incidents of the commission of an offence, taken together, may amount to a course of conduct, if one or more of the following circumstances exist: ( a ) where the offence is one that has an identifiable victim, the victim in each alleged incident is the same person or belongs to the same class of persons; ( b ) all of the alleged incidents involve the employment of the same method or similar methods; ( c ) all of the alleged incidents occurred in the same place, in similar places, or in places that are located near to each other; ( d ) all of the alleged incidents occurred within a defined period that does not exceed 12 months. [19/2018] (6) To avoid doubt, subsection (5) does not contain an exhaustive list of the circumstances where 2 or more alleged incidents of the commission of an offence, taken together, may amount to a course of conduct. [19/2018] (7) Subsection (4) ceases to apply to 2 or more alleged incidents of the commission of the same offence by the accused, if the accused indicates that the accused intends to rely on a different defence in relation to each of those alleged incidents. [19/2018] (8) Subject to subsection (7), where a charge is framed under subsection (2) or (4), and a person is convicted of the offence specified in that charge — ( a ) the court may sentence that person — (i) in any case where the charge is framed under subsection (2) — to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable for that offence; or (ii) in any case where the charge is framed under subsection (4) — to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable if that person had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence mentioned in that subsection; but ( b ) any sentence of caning imposed by the court in respect of that offence must not exceed the specified limit in section 328. [19/2018] (9) Despite anything to the contrary in this Code, where a Magistrate’s Court or District Court would (apart from this section) have jurisdiction and power to try a particular type of offence, and a charge specifying an offence of that type is framed under subsection (2) or (4) — the Magistrate’s Court or District Court (as the case may be) — ( a ) has jurisdiction to hear and determine all proceedings for the offence specified in that charge; and ( b ) has power to award the full punishment provided under subsection (8) in respect of the offence specified in that charge. [19/2018] (10) Subsections (8) and (9) do not apply to a charge framed under subsection (2) or (4) in respect of any act or omission that took place before 31 October 2018. [19/2018]"

If D ’s statement is in the prosecution’s possession and the prosecution did not include the statement in either the list of exhibits mentioned in section 214(1)( c ) or a notice mentioned in section 231, D ’s statement constitutes unused material if — (i) the prosecution’s case is that both A and B broke into C ’s house and killed C ; (ii) A ’s statement or statements to the relevant law enforcement agency or Case for the Defence states that A was not at C ’s house at the time of the murder; or (iii) A gives testimony in court that A was not at C ’s house at the time of the murder. ( b ) An anonymous letter to a police officer investigating an offence that contains a bare assertion that the accused is not guilty of the offence does not constitute unused material if the police is unable to trace the identity of the person who wrote the letter. ( c ) A photograph of a room where a murder was committed taken a long time after the murder, and after the room has been renovated such that it no longer resembles what it looked like at the time of the murder, does not constitute unused material. ( d ) A statement of a person ( A ) that A had committed the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, instead of the accused, does not constitute unused material if it is incontrovertible that A was not at the scene of the crime when the offence was committed. (2) In this Part, “material witness” means any witness (other than a prosecution witness) who may confirm or contradict, in material respects, an accused’s defence as set out in — ( a ) the accused’s statement or statements to the relevant law enforcement agency; ( b ) the Case for the Defence; or ( c ) the accused’s testimony in court. (3) For the purpose of determining what the accused’s defence is for the purposes of subsection (1)( d )(ii) or (2) or section 221B(2), any defence that cannot reasonably be ascertained from the accused’s statement or statements to the relevant law enforcement agency, the Case for the Defence or the accused’s testimony in court is to be disregarded. (4) In subsections (1)( d )(ii), (2)( a ) and (3) and section 221B(2), “accused’s statement” means — ( a ) any written statement made by the accused at any time and recorded by an officer of the relevant law enforcement agency; or ( b ) any statement made by the accused at any time to an officer of the relevant law enforcement agency, that is recorded in the form of an audiovisual recording.

      "content": "247. —(1) When a court, which is holding or about to hold any inquiry, trial or other proceeding, has reason to suspect that the accused, by reason of unsoundness of mind or any physical or mental condition, is incapable of making the accused’s defence, the court must in the first instance investigate whether the accused is in fact so incapable. (2) The investigation may be held in the absence of the accused if the court is satisfied that, owing to the accused’s state of mind or physical or mental condition, it would be in the interests of the safety of the accused or of any other person, or in the interests of public decency, that the accused should be absent. (3) For the purposes of the investigation, the court may — ( a ) receive as evidence a certificate in writing signed by a medical practitioner stating that, in the opinion of the medical practitioner, the accused — (i) is incapable of making the accused’s defence by reason of unsoundness of mind or any physical or mental condition; or (ii) is a proper person to be detained for observation and treatment in a psychiatric institution; or ( b ) if the court sees fit, take oral evidence from a medical practitioner on the accused’s state of mind or physical or mental condition. (4) If the court, on its own motion or on the application of the Public Prosecutor, is not satisfied that the accused is capable of making the accused’s defence, the court must — ( a ) postpone the inquiry, trial or other proceeding; and ( b ) order that the accused be remanded for observation in a psychiatric institution for a period not exceeding one month. (5) During the period of the accused’s remand (including any extension under subsection (8) of that period), a designated medical practitioner must — ( a ) keep the accused under observation; and ( b ) provide any necessary treatment. (6) Before the expiry of the period of the accused’s remand (including any extension under subsection (8) of that period) — ( a ) the designated medical practitioner must certify in writing to the court the designated medical practitioner’s opinion on the following matters: (i) the accused’s state of mind or physical or mental condition and, consequently, the accused’s ability to make the accused’s defence; (ii) whether there is any risk that the accused, if released, may injure himself or any other person; (iii) if there is any such risk — (A) the extent of that risk; (B) the conditions (if any) that may be imposed to minimise that risk; and (C) the extent to which each such condition (if any) will minimise that risk; or ( b ) if the designated medical practitioner is unable within that period to form a conclusion on one or more of the matters mentioned in paragraph ( a )(i), (ii) and (iii), the designated medical practitioner must — (i) certify in writing to the court the matters mentioned in paragraph ( a )(i), (ii) and (iii) on which the designated medical practitioner is unable within that period to form a conclusion; and (ii) request for the accused to be further remanded for observation in a psychiatric institution for a period not exceeding 2 months at any one time. (7) For the purposes of subsection (6)( a )(iii)(B), the conditions that the designated medical practitioner may certify to be conditions that may be imposed to minimise the risk that the accused, if released, may injure himself or any other person, include the following conditions: ( a ) the accused must reside at a place, such as a nursing home in respect of which a licence is granted under the Healthcare Services Act 2020, that is specified by the designated medical practitioner; [Act 19 of 2025 wef 05/12/2025] [Act 3 of 2020 wef 26/06/2023] ( b ) the accused must present himself for any medical treatment that is specified by the designated medical practitioner; ( c ) the accused must take any medication that is specified by the designated medical practitioner; ( d ) a person must supervise the accused’s compliance with any conditions that are imposed on the accused to minimise that risk.

      "content": "258. —(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), where any person is charged with an offence, any statement made by the person, whether it is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after the person is charged and whether or not in the course of any investigation carried out by any law enforcement agency, is admissible in evidence at the person’s trial; and if that person tenders himself or herself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross‑examination and for the purpose of impeaching that person’s credit. (2) Where a statement mentioned in subsection (1) is made by any person to a police officer, no such statement may be used in evidence if it is made to a police officer below the rank of sergeant. (3) The court must refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement the accused would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against the accused. Explanation 1 — If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his or her acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, the accused would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against the accused, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise (as the case may be), which will render the statement inadmissible. Explanation 2 — If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances: ( a ) under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused for the purpose of obtaining it; ( aa ) where the accused is informed in writing by a person in authority of the circumstances in section 33B of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 under which life imprisonment may be imposed in lieu of death; ( b ) when the accused was intoxicated; ( c ) in answer to questions which the accused need not have answered whatever may have been the form of those questions; ( d ) where the accused was not warned that the accused was not bound to make the statement and that evidence of it might be given against the accused; ( e ) where the recording officer or the interpreter of an accused’s statement recorded under section 22 or 23 did not fully comply with that section; or ( f ) where an accused’s statement under section 22 or 23 is in writing, when section 22(5) or 23(3B) (as the case may be) requires the statement to be recorded in the form of an audiovisual recording. [30/2012; 19/2018] (4) If the statement mentioned in subsection (3) is made after the impression caused by any such inducement, threat or promise mentioned in that subsection has, in the opinion of the court, been fully removed, it is admissible. (4A) For the purposes of subsection (3), the making of a statement by an accused is not to be regarded as caused by any inducement, threat or promise merely because a person in authority had earlier informed the accused that the accused was required or legally bound to give information under section 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960, if that person believed in good faith, when so informing the accused, that — ( a ) the accused was concerned in an offence under that Act; or ( b ) a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, that the accused was concerned in an offence under that Act. [19/2018] (5) When 2 or more persons are tried jointly in any of the following circumstances, and a confession made by one such person affecting that person and any other such person is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who made the confession: ( a ) all of those persons are tried jointly for the same offence; ( b ) the proof of the facts alleged in the charge for the offence for which one of those persons ( A ) is tried (excluding any fact relating to any intent or state of mind on the part of A necessary to constitute the offence for which A is tried) would, for each of the rest of those persons, result in the proof of the facts alleged in the charge for the offence for which that person is tried (excluding any fact relating to any intent or state of mind on the part of that person necessary to constitute the offence for which that person is tried); ( c ) at least one of those persons is tried for an offence under section 411, 412, 413 or 414 of the Penal Code 1871 in respect of any property, and the rest of those persons are tried for one or more of the offences of theft, extortion, robbery, criminal misappropriation, criminal breach of trust or cheating under Chapter 17 of the Penal Code 1871 in respect of the same property. [19/2018] (5A) Despite subsection (5), the court may refuse to take into consideration a confession as against a person (other than the maker of the confession), if the prejudicial effect of the confession on that person outweighs the probative value of the confession. [19/2018] (5B) In subsection (5), “offence” includes an abetment of, a conspiracy to commit, or an attempt to commit, the offence. Illustrations ( a ) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C . It is proved that A said “ B and I murdered C ”. The court may consider the effect of this confession as against B . ( b ) A is on trial for the murder of C . There is evidence to show that C was murdered by A and B and that B said “ A and I murdered C ”. This statement may not be taken into consideration by the court against A as B is not being jointly tried. ( c ) A is charged with an offence of corruptly giving a gratification to B under section 5( b ) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960. B is charged with an offence of corruptly receiving the same gratification from A under section 5( a ) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960. A and B are jointly tried for those offences. If a confession made by A affecting both A and B is proved, and the same facts are alleged in the charges against A and B , the court may take into consideration the confession as against B , even though A and B are charged with offences that have different elements. [19/2018] (6) Despite any other provision in this section — ( a ) where a person is charged with any offence in relation to the making or contents of any statement made by the person to any officer of a law enforcement agency in the course of any investigation carried out by the agency, that statement may be used as evidence in the prosecution; ( b ) any statement made by the accused in the course of an identification parade may be used as evidence; and ( c ) when any fact or thing is discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of any officer of a law enforcement agency, so much of such information as relates distinctly to the fact or thing thereby discovered may be proved. (7) In this section, “confession”, in relation to any person who is tried for an offence, means any statement made at any time by the person stating or suggesting the inference that the person committed that offence."

(3) The following procedure must be complied with at an ancillary hearing: ( a ) the party seeking to admit the evidence must produce the party’s evidence on the ancillary issue; ( b ) the party must then examine the party’s witnesses (if any) and each of the witnesses may in turn be cross‑examined by the other party and every co‑accused (as the case may be), after which the first party may re-examine the witnesses; ( c ) after the party has concluded the party’s case, the court must call on the other party to present the other party’s evidence; ( d ) when the other party is called on to present the other party’s evidence, the other party must examine the other party’s witnesses (if any) and each of the witnesses may in turn be cross‑examined by the first party and every co‑accused (as the case may be), after which the witnesses may be re‑examined; ( e ) an accused may apply to the court to issue process for compelling the attendance of any witness and the production of any exhibit in court, whether or not the witness has previously been examined in the case, for the purpose of examination or cross‑examination; ( f ) the court must issue process unless it considers that the application made under paragraph ( e ) should be refused because it is frivolous or vexatious or made to delay or frustrate justice and in such a case the court must record the reasons for the order; ( g ) before summoning any witness pursuant to an application under paragraph ( e ), the court may require that the reasonable expenses incurred by the witness in attending the trial be deposited in court by the defence; ( h ) at the close of the other party’s case, whether or not evidence has been adduced in accordance with section 283, the first party has the right to call a person as a witness or recall and re‑examine a person already examined, for the purpose of rebuttal, and the witness may be cross‑examined by the other party and every co‑accused, after which the first party may re‑examine the witness; ( i ) at the close of the other party’s case, the first party may sum up the first party’s case; ( j ) the first party has the final right of reply on the whole case; ( k ) before proceeding with the main trial, the court must make a ruling on the admissibility of the statement or the other evidence which has been objected to by any party to the proceedings. (4) Where a witness, other than an accused, is giving evidence for the prosecution or the defence, the court may, on the application of either party, interpose that witness with any other witness if the court is of the view that there are good reasons to do so. (5) If any evidence has been given in any ancillary hearing relating to the statement or the other evidence which has been objected to by any party to the proceedings, any such evidence which is relevant for the purposes of the main trial is admissible without the need to recall any of the witnesses to give evidence. (6) The court may, in the interests of justice, allow any witness who has testified at the ancillary hearing to be recalled during the trial for examination or cross-examination by the prosecution or the defence, as the case may be. (7) If the court, after hearing evidence in the main trial, is doubtful about the correctness of its earlier decision whether or not to admit the evidence at the ancillary hearing, it may call on the prosecution and the defence to make further submissions. (8) If the court, after hearing any submissions, decides to reverse its earlier decision in admitting the evidence, it must disregard such evidence when determining whether or not to call for the defence or when determining the guilt or otherwise of the accused. (9) If the court, after hearing any submissions, decides to reverse its earlier decision in not admitting the evidence, such evidence may be admitted in court for the purpose of determining whether or not to call for the defence or when determining the guilt or otherwise of the accused.

[15/2019] (3) Where the court is satisfied that by reason of exceptional circumstances it would be unjust to impose on a first‑time offender the presumptive minimum sentence prescribed for an offence the first‑time offender is convicted of, the court must impose a sentence of the same type of punishment but that is less than the presumptive minimum sentence prescribed for that offence.

[19/2018] (1A) A mandatory treatment order may also require an offender to reside in a psychiatric institution during the whole or a specified part of the period that the offender is required to undergo psychiatric treatment.

(4A) A court may include the requirement mentioned in subsection (1A) in a mandatory treatment order only upon the recommendation of the appointed psychiatrist. [19/2018] (5) In assessing whether an offender is a person suitable for treatment for his or her psychiatric condition, the appointed psychiatrist may take into account the following factors: ( a ) whether the offender is likely to attend the treatment sessions on such day and at such time and place as the appointed psychiatrist may require; ( b ) the physical and mental state of the offender; ( c ) the financial standing of the offender and his or her ability to pay all or any part of the costs of his or her treatment which it is reasonable for him or her to pay. (6) For the purpose of obtaining the report from an appointed psychiatrist, a court may order that an offender — ( a ) be remanded for observation in a psychiatric institution for a period or periods, not exceeding 3 weeks in the case of any single period, as the court thinks necessary to enable the report to be submitted by the appointed psychiatrist; or ( b ) attend at a psychiatric institution for assessment to enable the report to be submitted by the appointed psychiatrist.

(5) If the offence stated in the altered charge is one that requires the Public Prosecutor’s consent under section 10, then the appeal must not proceed before such consent is obtained, unless the consent has already been obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered charge is based. (6) After the appellate court has framed an altered charge, it must ask the accused if the accused intends to offer a defence.

(8) If the accused indicates that the accused does not intend to offer a defence, the appellate court may — ( a ) convict the accused on the altered charge (other than a charge which carries the death penalty) if it is satisfied that, based on the records before the court, there is sufficient evidence to do so; or ( b ) order that the accused be tried by a trial court of competent jurisdiction, if it is not satisfied that, based on the records before the court, there is sufficient evidence to convict the accused on the altered charge. (9) At the hearing of the appeal, the appellate court may on the application of the Public Prosecutor, and with the consent of the accused, take into consideration any outstanding offences which the accused admits to have committed for the purposes of sentencing the accused. (10) The sentencing powers of the appellate court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction do not exceed the sentencing power of the trial court whose judgment, sentence or order is appealed against.

(2) Any application, authorisation, consent, direction, fiat, instruction, order, requirement or sanction of the Public Prosecutor given or made under the repealed Code before 2 January 2011 and which remains in force or which is not complied with before that date is treated as if it were an application, authorisation, consent, direction, fiat, instruction, order or requirement of the Public Prosecutor given or made under the corresponding provisions of this Code. (3) Any summons, warrant or requisition issued by a court under the repealed Code before 2 January 2011 and which has not been complied with or executed before that date is treated as if it were a summons, warrant or requisition (as the case may be) issued under the corresponding provisions of this Code. (4) Any proclamation published by a court under section 51 of the repealed Code is treated as if it were a proclamation published under section 88. (5) Any authorisation given by the Commissioner of Police under section 70 of the repealed Code which is not acted on before 2 January 2011 is treated as if it were an authorisation of the Commissioner of Police given under section 33. (6) Any written order of a police officer under section 58 of the repealed Code which is not complied with before 2 January 2011 is treated as if it were a written order of a police officer under section 20. (7) Any order of a police officer under section 120 of the repealed Code which is not complied with before 2 January 2011 is treated as if it were an order of a police officer under section 21. (8) Any requisition made by a police officer or authorised person under section 125A or 125B of the repealed Code before 2 January 2011 which is not complied with before that date is deemed to be a requisition made by a police officer or an authorised person under section 39 or 40, respectively. (9) Any plea of guilty by letter under section 137 of the repealed Code which is not dealt with by a court before 2 January 2011 is treated as if it were a plea of guilty by letter under section 154 and that provision applies accordingly to the plea of guilty. (10) Any plea of guilty under section 137A of the repealed Code which is not dealt with by a court before 2 January 2011 is treated as if it were a plea of guilty under section 226 and that provision applies accordingly to the plea of guilty. (11) Any bond executed by any person under the repealed Code before 2 January 2011 and which remains in force on or after that date is treated as if it were a bond executed under the corresponding provisions of this Code. (12) Any person who is subject to the supervision of the police under section 11 of the repealed Code is treated as if the person were a person subject to police supervision under section 309 of this Code. (13) Any information received or recorded under section 115 of the repealed Code which is not dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the repealed Code before 2 January 2011 is treated as if the information were received or recorded under section 14 and the police must deal with the matter in accordance with the provisions of this Code. (14) Any complaint which is received by a Magistrate before 2 January 2011 and which is not disposed of before that date, is treated as if it were a complaint received by a Magistrate under this Code and the provisions of this Code, with the necessary modifications, apply in relation to the complaint. (15) Any offence which is to be compounded under section 199A of the repealed Code and which is not so compounded before 2 January 2011 is treated as an offence which is to be compounded under section 243 of this Code. (16) Despite any other provisions in this Code, Part 19 applies, with the necessary modifications, to any property seized under the provisions of the repealed Code and which is not reported or disposed of in accordance with Chapter XXXVIII of the repealed Code. (17) Where any period of time specified in any provision in the repealed Code is current immediately before 2 January 2011, this Code has effect as if the corresponding provision in this Code had been in force when the period began to run; and (without affecting the foregoing) any period of time so specified and current is deemed for the purposes of this Code — ( a ) to run from the day or event from which it was running immediately before 2 January 2011; and ( b ) to expire (subject to any provision of this Code for its extension) whenever it would have expired if this Code had not been enacted, and any rights, priorities, liabilities, reliefs, obligations, requirements, powers, duties or exemptions dependent on the beginning, duration or end of such a period as abovementioned are under this Code as they were or would have been under that provision in the repealed Code. (18) Any subsidiary legislation made under the repealed Code and in force immediately before 2 January 2011, so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Code, continues to be in force as if made under this Code until it is revoked or repealed by subsidiary legislation made under this Code. (19) Insofar as it is necessary for preserving the effect of any written law, any reference in such written law to a seizable offence or a non-seizable offence is to be construed, respectively, as a reference to an arrestable offence or a non-arrestable offence under this Code. (20) Where in any written law reference is made to the sanction of the Public Prosecutor or a Deputy Public Prosecutor, such reference is to be read as a reference to the consent of the Public Prosecutor or a Deputy Public Prosecutor. (21) In any written law or document in which a reference is made to the repealed Code, such reference is to be read as a reference to this Code. (22) Where before 2 January 2011 any inquiry is held under Chapter XXX of the repealed Code and has not been concluded immediately before that date, the inquiry may continue in accordance with the provisions under the repealed Code relating to such inquiry as if this Code had not been enacted."
