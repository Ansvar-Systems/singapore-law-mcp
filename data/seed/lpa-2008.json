[35/2014; 40/2018] (3) Despite subsection (1), the Registrar may, on or after 3 January 2016, register a limited partnership under — ( a ) a name that is identical to the name of a foreign company registered under Division 2 of Part 11 of the Companies Act 1967 — (i) in respect of which notice was lodged under section 377(1) of the Companies Act 1967 that the foreign company has ceased to have a place of business in Singapore or ceased to carry on business in Singapore, if a period of at least 3 months has passed after the date of cessation; and (ii) the name of which was struck off the register kept under the Companies Act 1967 under section 377(8), (9) or (10) of that Act, if a period of at least 6 years has passed after the date the name was so struck off; or ( b ) a name that is identical to the name of a limited partnership in respect of which notice was lodged under section 19(1) that the limited partnership has ceased to carry on business, if a period of at least one year has passed after the date of cessation. [35/2014] (4) Despite this section and section 17B, where the Registrar is satisfied that a limited partnership’s name — ( a ) is one that is not permitted to be registered under subsection (1)( a ), ( b ) or ( d ); ( b ) is one that is not permitted to be registered under subsection (2) until the expiry of the relevant period mentioned in that subsection; ( c ) is one that is permitted to be registered under subsection (3) only after the expiry of the relevant period mentioned in that subsection; ( d ) so nearly resembles the name of any other limited partnership, any limited liability partnership or corporation or any registered business name, as to be likely to be mistaken for it; or ( e ) is one the use of which has been restrained by an injunction granted under the Trade Marks Act 1998, the Registrar may direct any general partner of the limited partnership to change the limited partnership’s name, and that person must comply with the direction within 6 weeks after the date of the direction or such longer period as the Registrar may allow in any case. [35/2014] (5) The Registrar’s power under subsection (4) to direct any general partner of a limited partnership to change its name applies regardless of — ( a ) whether the limited partnership’s name was registered through inadvertence or otherwise; or ( b ) when the limited partnership was registered in respect of the name.

[35/2014] (9) A person aggrieved by — ( a ) a direction of the Registrar under subsection (4); or ( b ) the Registrar’s refusal to give a direction to a person under subsection (4) following an application under subsection (6), may, within 30 days after being informed of the Registrar’s direction or refusal (as the case may be) appeal to the Minister whose decision is final. [35/2014] (10) To avoid doubt, where the Registrar makes a direction under subsection (4) or the Minister makes a decision on an appeal under subsection (9), the Registrar or the Minister (as the case may be) must accept as correct any decision of the General Division of the High Court to grant an injunction mentioned in subsection (4)( e ).
