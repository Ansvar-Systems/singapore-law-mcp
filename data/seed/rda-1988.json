(4) Nothing in this section operates to confer upon any person claiming without valuable consideration under any person any further priority or protection than would belong to the person under whom that person claims, and any disposition of land or charge on land which, if unregistered, would be fraudulent and void is, despite registration, fraudulent and void in like manner."
