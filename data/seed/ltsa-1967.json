      "content": "81. —(1) This section applies where a management corporation has, in accordance with section 84 of the Building (Strata Management) Act 2004, resolved to terminate the strata subdivision of the building. [Act 12 of 2020 wef 01/10/2025] (2) A management corporation must — ( a ) within 14 days after the passing of a resolution referred to in subsection (1), give notice of the resolution in one or more newspapers circulating in Singapore; and ( b ) within 30 days after the passing of the resolution, lodge an application with the Registrar to terminate the strata subdivision. (3) If a management corporation fails to comply with subsection (2), the management corporation and every officer of the management corporation who is in default shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000. (4) Upon registration of an application under subsection (2)( b ) to terminate the strata subdivision, the Registrar must cancel the relevant folios of the subsidiary strata land-register and enter a notification of the cancellation of the strata subdivision of the building and a memorial of the vesting of the parcel in the subsidiary proprietors as tenants-in-common in the relevant folio of the land‑register comprising the parcel. (5) Upon the entry of that memorial — ( a ) each subsidiary proprietor ceases to be a subsidiary proprietor of the lot, and is entitled to the parcel as a tenant‑in‑common with the other subsidiary proprietors in the shares proportional to the subsidiary proprietor’s share value and for the same term and tenure held by the subsidiary proprietor in respect of the subsidiary proprietor’s lot; ( b ) any subsisting encumbrance registered against a lot is an encumbrance on the share of the subsidiary proprietor concerned in the registered land comprising the parcel, and a memorial or notification of the encumbrance entered in the volume and folio of the land-register comprising that registered land must bear the same date as the date of registration of that encumbrance against the lot; and ( c ) all statutory easements implied under this Act cease to affect the registered land comprising the parcel or any part thereof. (6) The former subsidiary proprietors may by 90% resolution direct the management corporation to transfer the parcel or any part thereof. (7) The management corporation, if it is satisfied that the resolution was duly passed and that all persons having registered interests in the parcel have consented in writing to the release of their respective interests in the registered land comprising the parcel or any part thereof, intended to be transferred, must execute the appropriate transfer. (7A) The transfer under subsection (7) is valid and effective without execution by any person having a registered interest in the parcel, and the receipt of the management corporation for any moneys payable to the management corporation under the transfer is a sufficient discharge, and exonerates the person taking under the transfer from seeing to the application, or being answerable for any loss or misapplication, of the moneys expressed to have been so received. (8) A transfer under subsection (7) must not be accepted for registration unless accompanied by a certificate in the prescribed form under the seal of the management corporation that the resolution was duly passed and that all necessary consents were given, in favour of a purchaser of the parcel and in favour of the Registrar, and such a certificate is conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein. (9) When registered land or any part thereof is transferred by a former subsidiary proprietor or the management corporation after an application under subsection (2)( b ) to terminate the strata subdivision has been lodged with the Registrar — ( a ) the former subsidiary proprietor, if the transferor, must surrender to the Registrar the former subsidiary proprietor’s duplicate subsidiary strata certificate of title relating to the former subsidiary proprietor’s lot; ( b ) the management corporation, if it is transferring the land on behalf of all the former subsidiary proprietors, must surrender to the Registrar on behalf of all the former subsidiary proprietors their duplicate subsidiary strata certificates of title; and ( c ) the Registrar, on receipt of the duplicate subsidiary strata certificate or certificates of title comprising the lot or lots (as the case may be), must cancel the relevant folios of the subsidiary strata land-register, and the registration of the transfer is effected by the Registrar issuing a certificate of title for the undivided share in the registered land or for the whole of the registered land transferred to the transferee, as the case may be. (10) Despite the termination of a strata subdivision under this section, the relevant record of the subsidiary strata land-register may be used in evidence as a record of matters relating to the subdivision before its termination so long as the management corporation continues in existence. (11) Where a transfer of the parcel made under subsection (7) has been lodged with and registered by the Registrar, the management corporation continues in existence for the purpose of winding up its affairs. (12) Until a liquidator has been appointed by the management corporation for the purpose of carrying out the winding up of the management corporation, the council of the management corporation must continue to perform the management corporation’s business for the purpose of winding up its affairs. (13) On a management corporation being wound up — ( a ) every former subsidiary proprietor is liable to contribute to the assets of the management corporation to an amount sufficient for the payment of its debts and liabilities and the costs, charges and expenses of the winding up; and ( b ) the assets of the management corporation (if any) must be distributed among the former subsidiary proprietors, in the same proportion as the proportion of contributions for which the former subsidiary proprietors would have been liable in accordance with section 39(2) of the Building (Strata Management) Act 2004.

(2) Where a liquidator has not been appointed for a management corporation under this section, the court may, on the application of a former subsidiary proprietor, a former mortgagee or a creditor of the management corporation, appoint a liquidator for the management corporation. (3) On the appointment of a liquidator all the powers of the council of the management corporation cease and the liquidator has the power to carry on the management corporation’s business for the purpose of winding up its affairs. (4) The management corporation may in general meeting convened by any former subsidiary proprietor by special resolution of which special notice has been given to all the former subsidiary proprietors, former mortgagees, the creditors and the liquidators, remove any liquidator but no such resolution is effective to remove a liquidator if the court on the application of the liquidator or a creditor or a former mortgagee has ordered that the liquidator be not removed. (5) If a vacancy occurs by death, resignation, removal or otherwise in the office of a liquidator, the management corporation in general meeting must immediately fill the vacancy by the appointment of a liquidator and fix the remuneration to be paid to the liquidator, and for that purpose a general meeting may be convened by any former subsidiary proprietor or, if there were more liquidators than one, by the continuing liquidators. (6) The meeting must be held in the manner provided by this Act or in such manner as is on application by any former subsidiary proprietor or by the continuing liquidators determined by the court. (7) The court may, on the application of a former subsidiary proprietor, a former mortgagee or the liquidator and on being satisfied that the affairs of the management corporation have been wound up, make an order that the liquidator be released and that the management corporation be dissolved and on the expiry of 3 months of the lodging of the order with the Registrar and the Commissioner, the management corporation is dissolved. (8) Despite subsection (7), the court may, on the application of the liquidator or of any other person who appears to the court to be interested, make an order deferring the date at which the dissolution of the management corporation is to take effect for such time as the court thinks fit. (9) The person on whose application an order of the court under this section is made must, within 21 days after the making of the order, lodge with the Registrar and with the Commissioner a certified copy of the order, and if the person fails to do so the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000."
