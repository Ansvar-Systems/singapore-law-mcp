(9) A person, being a director of a company or a trustee for debenture holders, is not guilty of an offence under subsection (8), if the person shows that the person’s contravention of subsection (7) was due to the refusal of another director of the company or trustee for debenture holders to supply to the person the particulars of the person’s material interests affected by the compromise or arrangement.

(11) The following are not entitled to vote at the meeting referred to in subsection (2): ( a ) a creditor of the company that is — (i) a holding company, an ultimate holding company or a subsidiary of the company; (ii) a director or shareholder of the company; or (iii) a relative or spouse of a director or shareholder of the company; ( b ) a creditor of the company that is a subsidiary of another company of which the company is also a subsidiary.

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4)( b )(ii), in the case of any such floating charge created by an instrument before 15 May 1987, that instrument is deemed to contain a power to appoint a receiver and manager in the event that an application under this section is made for the appointment of a judicial manager, with the result that the holder of that floating charge must, in accordance with subsection (4)( b ), be given notice of the application.

(7) On hearing the application for a judicial management order, the Court may dismiss the application or adjourn the hearing conditionally or unconditionally or make an interim order or any other order that the Court thinks fit. (8) A judicial management order must not be made in relation to a company — ( a ) after the company has gone into liquidation; ( b ) where the company is a banking corporation or is a finance company licensed under the Finance Companies Act 1967; ( c ) where the company is a licensed insurer licensed under the Insurance Act 1966; or ( d ) where the company belongs to such class of companies as the Minister may by order in the Gazette prescribe. (9) The costs and expenses of any unsuccessful application for a judicial management order made under this section must, unless the Court otherwise orders, be borne by the applicant and, if the Court considers that the application is frivolous or vexatious, the Court may make such orders, as the Court thinks just and equitable, to redress any injustice that may have resulted.

(6) The reversal or modification on appeal of an order under subsection (1)( c ) or ( d ) does not affect the validity of any debt so incurred, or any security interest that was granted pursuant to the order, or the priority of that security interest, if the rescue financing (from which arose the debt intended to be secured by that security interest) was provided in good faith, whether or not with knowledge of the appeal, unless the order was stayed pending the appeal before the rescue financing was provided. (7) For the purposes of subsection (1)( d )(ii), there is adequate protection for the interests of the holder of an existing security interest on the property of a company, if — ( a ) the Court orders the company to make one or more cash payments to the holder, the total amount of which is sufficient to compensate the holder for any decrease in the value of the holder’s existing security interest that may result from the making of the order under subsection (1)( d ); ( b ) the Court orders the company to provide to the holder additional or replacement security of a value sufficient to compensate the holder for any decrease in the value of the holder’s existing security interest that may result from the making of the order under subsection (1)( d ); or ( c ) the Court grants any relief (other than compensation) that will result in the realisation by the holder of the indubitable equivalent of the holder’s existing security interest. (8) Sections 205, 224, 225 and 228 do not affect any priority conferred, any security interest or relief granted, or any payment made, pursuant to and in accordance with an order made by the Court under subsection (1). (9) The judicial manager must, within 14 days after the date of an order made under subsection (1), lodge a copy of the order with the Registrar of Companies. (10) In this section — “rescue financing” means any financing that satisfies one or more of the following conditions: ( a ) the financing is necessary for the survival of a company that obtains the financing, or of the whole or any part of the undertaking of that company, as a going concern; ( b ) the financing is necessary for the Court’s approval under section 210(4) of the Companies Act 1967 or section 71(5) of a compromise or an arrangement mentioned in section 210(1) of the Companies Act 1967 or section 71(1) (as the case may be) involving a company that obtains the financing; ( c ) the financing is necessary to achieve a more advantageous realisation of the assets of a company that obtains the financing, than on a winding up of that company; “security interest” means any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other type of security interest recognised by law; “super priority debt” means a debt, arising from any rescue financing obtained or to be obtained by a company, that is to have priority, pursuant to an order under subsection (1)( b ), over all the preferential debts specified in section 203(1)( a ) to ( i ) and all other unsecured debts, if the company is wound up."

[27/2019] (2) The amount payable under subsection (1)( d ), ( e ) and ( h ) must not exceed such amount as may be prescribed by the Minister by order in the Gazette . (3) In subsection (1)( d ), ( e ), ( g ) and ( h ) and this subsection — “employee” means an individual who has entered into or works under a contract of service with an employer, and includes a subcontractor of labour; “ex gratia payment” means an amount payable to an employee on the winding up of a company or on the termination of the employee’s service by his or her employer on the ground of redundancy or by reason of any re‑organisation of the employer, profession, business, trade or work, and “an amount payable to an employee” for these purposes means an amount ascertained from any contract of employment, award or agreement; “retrenchment benefit” means an amount payable to an employee on the winding up of a company or on the termination of the employee’s service by his or her employer on the ground of redundancy or by reason of any re‑organisation of the employer, profession, business, trade or work, and “an amount payable to an employee” for these purposes means an amount ascertained from any contract of employment, award or agreement, or if no amount is so ascertainable, such amount as is determined by the Commissioner for Labour or by an Employment Claims Tribunal constituted under section 4 of the State Courts Act 1970; “wages or salary” includes — ( a ) all arrears of money due to a subcontractor of labour; ( b ) any amount payable to an employee on account of wages or salary during a period of notice of termination of employment or in lieu of notice of such termination, whether such amount becomes payable before, on or after the commencement of the winding up; and ( c ) any amount payable to an employee, on termination of the employee’s employment, as a gratuity under any contract of employment or any award or agreement that regulates the conditions of the employee’s employment, whether such amount becomes payable before, on or after the commencement of the winding up. (4) The debts in each class specified in subsection (1) rank in the order specified in that subsection, but as between debts of the same class rank equally between themselves, and must be paid in full, unless the property of the company is insufficient to meet them, in which case the debts of the same class abate in equal proportions between themselves. (5) Where any payment has been made to any employee of the company on account of wages, salary or vacation leave out of money advanced by a person for that purpose, the person by whom the money was advanced, in a winding up — ( a ) has a right of priority in respect of the money so advanced and paid, up to the amount by which the sum in respect of which the employee would have been entitled to priority in the winding up has been diminished by reason of the payment; and ( b ) has the same right of priority in respect of that amount as the employee would have had if the payment had not been made. (6) So far as the assets of the company available for payment of general creditors are insufficient to meet any preferential debts specified in subsection (1)( a ), ( b ), ( c ), ( d ), ( e ), ( g ) and ( h ) and any amount payable in priority by virtue of subsection (5), those debts — ( a ) have priority over the claims of the holders of debentures under any floating charge created by the company (which charge, as created, was a floating charge); and ( b ) must be paid accordingly out of any property comprised in or subject to that charge. (7) Where the company is under a contract of insurance (entered into before the commencement of the winding up) insured against liability to third parties, then if any such liability is incurred by the company (whether before, on or after the commencement of the winding up) and an amount in respect of that liability is or has been received by the company or the liquidator from the insurer, the amount must, after deducting any expenses of or incidental to getting in such amount, be paid by the liquidator to the third party in respect of whom the liability was incurred, to the extent necessary to discharge that liability or any part of that liability remaining undischarged, in priority to all payments in respect of the debts mentioned in subsection (1). (8) If the liability of the insurer to the company is less than the liability of the company to the third party, nothing in subsection (7) limits the rights of the third party in respect of the balance. (9) Subsections (7) and (8) have effect despite any agreement to the contrary entered into after 29 December 1967. (10) Despite anything in subsection (1) — ( a ) paragraph ( f ) of that subsection does not apply in relation to the winding up of a company in any case where — (i) the company is being wound up voluntarily merely for the purpose of reconstruction or of amalgamation with another company, and the right to the compensation has on the reconstruction or amalgamation been preserved to the person entitled to that right; or (ii) the company has entered into a contract with an insurer in respect of any liability under any law relating to work injury compensation; and ( b ) where a company has given security for the payment or repayment of any amount to which paragraph ( i ) of that subsection relates, that paragraph applies only in relation to the balance remaining due after deducting from that amount the net amount realised from such security."

(4) An estimate is to be made by the judicial manager or liquidator of the value of any debt or liability provable under this section that, by reason of its being subject to any contingency or contingencies, or for any other reason, does not bear a certain value. (5) Any person aggrieved by any such estimate by the judicial manager or liquidator may appeal to the Court. (6) If in the opinion of the Court the value of the debt or liability cannot be fairly estimated, the Court may make an order to that effect, and upon the making of that order the debt or liability is, for the purposes of this Act, deemed to be a debt not provable in the judicial management or winding up of the company. (7) If in the opinion of the Court the value of the debt or liability can be fairly estimated, the Court may assess the value of the debt or liability and may give all necessary directions for the purpose of valuing the debt or liability, and the amount of the value when assessed is deemed to be a debt provable in the judicial management or winding up of the company. (8) An amount payable under any order made by a court under any written law relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime is provable in the judicial management or winding up of a company."

(2) Subsection (1)( c ), in relation to the disposal of property, does not apply to the payment of ordinary expenses of the debtor and the debtor’s dependants. (3) For the purpose of subsection (1)( h ), a debtor enters into a transaction with a person at an undervalue if the debtor — ( a ) makes a gift to that person or otherwise enters into a transaction with that person on terms that provide for the debtor to receive no consideration; ( b ) enters into a transaction with that person in consideration of marriage; or ( c ) enters into a transaction with that person for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by the debtor. (4) The Official Assignee must not issue any certificate of failure of a debt repayment scheme under subsection (1) in respect of any transaction entered into by the debtor at an undervalue unless the debtor was insolvent at the time the debtor entered into the transaction or became insolvent in consequence of the transaction.

(8) A debtor who has given an unfair preference to a person who, at the time the unfair preference was given, was an associate of the debtor (otherwise than by reason only of being the debtor’s employee) is presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to have been influenced in deciding to give it by such a desire as is mentioned in subsection (7)( b ). (9) The fact that something has been done pursuant to an order of a court does not, without more, prevent the doing or suffering of that thing from constituting the giving of an unfair preference. (10) For the purposes of this section, a debtor is insolvent if — ( a ) the debtor is unable to pay the debtor’s debts as they fall due; or ( b ) the value of the debtor’s assets is less than the amount of the debtor’s liabilities, taking into account the debtor’s contingent and prospective liabilities.

(2) Where a creditor’s bankruptcy application which relies on a statutory demand is made, pursuant to section 314, before 21 days have elapsed after the statutory demand was served, the Court hearing the application must not make a bankruptcy order until at least 21 days have elapsed after the statutory demand was served. (3) The Court may dismiss the application if — ( a ) it is not satisfied with the proof of the applicant creditor’s debt or debts; ( b ) it is not satisfied with the proof of the service of the application on the debtor; ( c ) it is satisfied that the debtor is able to pay all of the debtor’s debts; ( d ) it is satisfied that the debtor has made an offer to secure or compound for the applicant creditor’s debt the acceptance of which offer would have required the dismissal of the application and the offer has been unreasonably refused by the applicant creditor; or ( e ) it is satisfied that for other sufficient cause no order ought to be made on the application. (4) In determining for the purposes of subsection (3)( c ) whether the debtor is able to pay all of the debtor’s debts, the Court is to take into account the debtor’s contingent and prospective liabilities. (5) When a bankruptcy application has been made against a debtor on the ground that the debtor — ( a ) has failed to pay a judgment debt, and there is pending an appeal from or an application to set aside, the judgment or order by virtue of which the judgment debt is payable; or ( b ) has failed to comply with a statutory demand, and there is pending an application to set aside the statutory demand, the Court may, if it thinks fit, stay or dismiss the application. (6) Where the debtor appears at the hearing of the application and denies that the debtor is — ( a ) indebted to the applicant; or ( b ) indebted to such an amount as would justify the applicant making a bankruptcy application against the debtor, the Court may, subject to subsection (7), stay all proceedings on the application for such time as may be required for trial of the question relating to the debt. (7) The Court may not order any stay of proceedings under subsection (6) unless the debtor furnishes such security as the Court may order for payment to the applicant of — ( a ) any debt which may be established against the debtor in due course of law; and ( b ) the costs of establishing the debt. (8) Where proceedings are stayed, the Court may, if by reason of the delay caused by the stay of proceedings or for any other cause it thinks just, make a bankruptcy order on the application of some other creditor and dismiss, on such terms as it thinks just, the application in which proceedings have been stayed. (9) If a bankruptcy order may be made on the bankruptcy application, the Court must, instead of making the order, adjourn the bankruptcy application for a period of 6 months or such other period as the Court may direct and refer the matter to the Official Assignee for the purpose of enabling the Official Assignee to determine whether the debtor is suitable for a debt repayment scheme under Part 15, if all of the following qualifying criteria are satisfied: ( a ) the debt or the aggregate of the debts in respect of which the bankruptcy application is made does not exceed the prescribed amount; ( b ) the debtor is not an undischarged bankrupt, and has not been a bankrupt at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy application is made, under this Act; ( c ) a voluntary arrangement under Part 14 in respect of the debtor is not in effect, and was not in effect at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy application is made; ( d ) the debtor is not subject to any debt repayment scheme under Part 15, and has not been subject to any such debt repayment scheme at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy application is made; ( e ) the debtor is not a sole proprietor, a partner of a firm within the meaning of the Partnership Act 1890, or a partner in a limited liability partnership. (10) The Court is to proceed to hear a bankruptcy application adjourned under subsection (9) if — ( a ) the Official Assignee reports to the Court under section 289(2) that the debtor is not suitable for a debt repayment scheme under Part 15; or ( b ) at the end of the period of adjournment, a debt repayment scheme has not commenced under Part 15 in respect of the debtor. (11) If at any time during the period of adjournment of a bankruptcy application under subsection (9) a debt repayment scheme commences under Part 15 in respect of the debtor, the bankruptcy application is deemed to be withdrawn on the date of commencement of the debt repayment scheme. (12) The Court may give such orders or directions as it thinks fit for the adjournment, hearing or disposal of a bankruptcy application mentioned in subsection (9). (13) For the purpose of subsection (9)( d ), a person in respect of whom the Official Assignee issues — ( a ) a certificate of inapplicability of a debt repayment scheme under section 299; or ( b ) a certificate of completion of a debt repayment scheme under section 301(1) — (i) which states that all the debts (including interest on each of such debts at the rate to which a creditor is entitled under any written law or rule of law) of the person which have been proved under, and all the costs and expenses of, the debt repayment scheme have been paid in full; and (ii) which has not been revoked under section 302(1), is not to be treated as having been subject to that debt repayment scheme.

(3) If a bankruptcy order may be made on the bankruptcy application, the Court must, instead of making the order, adjourn the bankruptcy application for a period of 6 months or such other period as the Court may direct and refer the matter to the Official Assignee for the purpose of enabling the Official Assignee to determine whether the debtor is suitable for a debt repayment scheme under Part 15, if all of the following qualifying criteria are satisfied: ( a ) the aggregate of the debts specified in the statement of affairs exhibited to the debtor’s affidavit under section 308(2) does not exceed the amount mentioned in section 316(9)( a ); ( b ) the debtor is not an undischarged bankrupt, and has not been a bankrupt at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy application is made, under this Act; ( c ) a voluntary arrangement under Part 14 in respect of the debtor is not in effect, and was not in effect at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy application is made; ( d ) the debtor is not subject to any debt repayment scheme under Part 15, and has not been subject to any such debt repayment scheme at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy application is made; ( e ) the debtor is not a sole proprietor, a partner of a firm within the meaning of the Partnership Act 1890 or a partner in a limited liability partnership.

(5) If at any time during the period of adjournment of a bankruptcy application under subsection (3) a debt repayment scheme commences under Part 15 in respect of the debtor, the bankruptcy application is deemed to be withdrawn on the date of commencement of the debt repayment scheme. (6) The Court may give such orders or directions as it thinks fit for the adjournment, hearing or disposal of a bankruptcy application mentioned in subsection (3). (7) For the purpose of subsection (3)( d ), a person in respect of whom the Official Assignee issues — ( a ) a certificate of inapplicability of a debt repayment scheme under section 299; or ( b ) a certificate of completion of a debt repayment scheme under section 301(1) — (i) which states that all the debts (including interest on each of such debts at the rate to which a creditor is entitled under any written law or rule of law) of the person which have been proved under, and all the costs and expenses of, the debt repayment scheme have been paid in full; and (ii) which has not been revoked under section 302(1), is not to be treated as having been subject to that debt repayment scheme.

(2) An order under section 361 or 362 may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not that person is the person with whom the individual in question entered into the transaction or (as the case may be) the person to whom the unfair preference was given. (3) An order under section 361 or 362 does not — ( a ) prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than that individual and was acquired in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest; or ( b ) require a person who received a benefit from the transaction or unfair preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the Official Assignee, except where the person was a party to the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of an unfair preference given to that person at a time when that person was a creditor of that individual. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3)( a ) and ( b ), a person (called in this section the relevant person) who has acquired an interest in property from a person other than the individual in question, or who has received a benefit from the transaction or unfair preference, is presumed (unless the contrary is shown) to have acquired the interest or received the benefit (as the case may be) otherwise than in good faith if, at the time of the acquisition or receipt — ( a ) the relevant person had notice of the relevant surrounding circumstances and of the relevant proceedings; or ( b ) the relevant person was an associate of, or was connected with — (i) the individual in question; or (ii) the person with whom the individual in question entered into the transaction, or to whom the individual gave the unfair preference, as the case may be. (5) Any sums required to be paid to the Official Assignee in accordance with an order under section 361 or 362 are to be comprised in the bankrupt’s estate. (6) For the purposes of subsection (4)( a ), the relevant surrounding circumstances are — ( a ) the fact that the individual in question entered into the transaction at an undervalue; or ( b ) the circumstances which amounted to the giving of the unfair preference by the individual in question. (7) For the purposes of subsection (4)( a ), the relevant person has notice of the relevant proceedings if the relevant person has notice of — ( a ) the making of the bankruptcy application on which the individual in question is adjudged bankrupt; or ( b ) the fact that the individual in question has been adjudged bankrupt. (8) Despite section 364(1), for the purposes of subsection (4)( b )(ii), a company is regarded as an associate of another company if — ( a ) the same person controls both companies; ( b ) a person controls one company and either an associate of that person controls, or that person and the associate control, the other company; or ( c ) each company is controlled by a group of 2 or more persons, and the groups — (i) consist of the same persons; or (ii) can be regarded as consisting of the same persons if (in one or more cases) a member of either group is replaced by an associate of that member. (9) For the purposes of subsection (4)( b ), the relevant person is connected with a company if the relevant person — ( a ) is a director of the company; or ( b ) is an associate of — (i) the company; or (ii) a director of the company. (10) In subsection (9), “director” has the meaning given by section 4(1) of the Companies Act 1967."

(2) The Official Assignee or any creditor of a deceased debtor whose debt would have been sufficient to support a bankruptcy application against the debtor had the debtor been alive, may make to the Court an application for an order for the administration of the estate of the deceased debtor according to Parts 16 to 21. (3) Every application under this section is to be in the same form as a creditor’s bankruptcy application under section 307, with such variations as the case may require, except that in the case of an application by the Official Assignee, it is not necessary to allege or prove that any debt is owing to the applicant. (4) Upon the prescribed notice being given to the legal representative (if any) of the deceased debtor, the Court may, in the prescribed manner, upon proof of the applicant’s debt, unless the Court is satisfied that there is a reasonable probability that the estate will be sufficient for the payment of the debts owing by the deceased debtor, make an order for the administration in bankruptcy of the deceased debtor’s estate, or may, upon cause being shown, dismiss the application with or without costs. (5) An application for administration under this section must not be made to the Court after proceedings have been commenced for the administration of the deceased debtor’s estate, except that the Court may, in that case, on the application of any creditor and on proof that the estate is insufficient to pay its debts in the prescribed manner, make an order for the administration of the estate of the deceased debtor in bankruptcy, and the like consequences ensue as under an administration order made on the application of a creditor. (6) An administration order under this section must not be made until the expiration of 2 months after the date of the grant of probate or letters of administration, unless with the concurrence of the legal representative of the deceased debtor. (7) Upon an administration order being made under this section, the property of the debtor vests in the Official Assignee as trustee of the property without any further conveyance, transfer or assignment, and the Official Assignee must forthwith proceed to realise and distribute the same in accordance with Parts 16 to 21. (8) Sections 334, 335 and 336 so far as they relate to persons other than the debtor, and, with the modifications under this section, all the provisions of Part 17, so far as the same are applicable, apply to the case of an administration order under this section, and for the purposes of such application, unless the context otherwise requires, every reference to a bankrupt is to be read as a reference to the legal representative of the deceased debtor. (9) Sections 361, 367 and 368 apply in the case of an administration order under this section as if the administration order were a bankruptcy order. (10) In the administration of the property of the deceased debtor under an administration order, the Official Assignee must have regard to any claims by the legal representative of the deceased debtor to payment of the proper funeral and testamentary expenses incurred by the legal representative in and about the debtor’s estate, and such claims are deemed to be preferential debts under the administration order and are payable in full out of the debtor’s estate in priority to all other debts. (11) If on the administration of a deceased debtor’s estate any surplus remains in the hands of the Official Assignee after payment in full of all the debts due from the debtor, together with the costs of the administration and interest as provided by Parts 16 to 21 in the case of a bankruptcy, the surplus is, subject to section 391(2), to be paid over to the legal representative of the deceased debtor’s estate or dealt with in such other manner as is prescribed. (12) Upon notice being given to the legal representative of a deceased debtor of the making by a creditor of an application under this section, and in the event of an administration order being made on the application, no payment or transfer of property made by the legal representative after the giving of the notice operates as a discharge to the legal representative as between the legal representative and the Official Assignee. (13) Subject to this section, nothing in this section invalidates any payment made or act or thing done in good faith by the legal representative before the date of the administration order."
