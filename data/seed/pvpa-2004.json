(4) Despite subsection (1)( a ), where this Act did not apply to a plant genus or species before 30 July 2014, and an application for a grant of protection is made within one year after that date in respect of any plant variety belonging to that plant genus or species, that plant variety is deemed to be new if harvested or propagating material of that plant variety has not been sold, or otherwise disposed of, in Singapore to another person, by or with the breeder’s consent for the purposes of exploitation in Singapore of that plant variety — ( a ) earlier than 6 years before the date that application is made, in the case of trees or vines; or ( b ) earlier than 4 years before the date that application is made, in any other case.

(2) The grantee may give an authorisation subject to conditions and limitations. (3) A grant of protection is personal property and may be assigned or transmitted in the same way as other personal property. (4) An assignment of a grant of protection under subsection (3) is not effective unless it is in writing and signed by or on behalf of the assignor. (5) Subject to subsection (6), a licence granted by a grantee in respect of any protected variety is binding on every successor in title to the grantee’s interest — ( a ) except any person who, in good faith and without any notice (actual or constructive) of the licence, has given valuable consideration for the interest in the grant of protection; or ( b ) unless the licence provides otherwise, and any reference in this Act to doing anything with, or without, the consent of the grantee is to be construed accordingly. (6) Every person is deemed to have notice of a licence if the prescribed particulars of the grant of the licence are entered in the register under section 42. (7) Subject to sections 31 and 32, the rights of a grantee under subsection (1) also apply to harvested material, including entire plants and parts of plants, obtained through the unauthorised use of propagating material of the protected variety unless the grantee has had a reasonable opportunity, before the harvested material was obtained, to exercise the grantee’s rights in relation to the unauthorised use of the propagating material."
