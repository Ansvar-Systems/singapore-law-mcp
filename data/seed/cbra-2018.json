(6) Before the LTA makes or confirms a provisional order, the LTA must give notice to the licensee concerned — ( a ) stating that the LTA proposes to make or confirm the provisional order and setting out its effect; ( b ) setting out — (i) the relevant licence condition or code of practice for the purpose of securing compliance with which the provisional order is to be made or confirmed; (ii) the acts or omissions which, in the LTA’s opinion, constitute or would constitute contraventions of that licence condition or code of practice; and (iii) the other facts which, in the LTA’s opinion, justify the making or confirmation of the provisional order; and ( c ) specifying the period (not being less than 28 days after the date of service of the notice) within which representations with respect to the proposed provisional order or proposed confirmation may be made, and must consider any representation which is duly made and not withdrawn.
