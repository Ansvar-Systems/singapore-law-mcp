(6) Where a person has become bound under this section to offer or cause to be offered any gold or specified currency for sale to an authorised dealer and has not complied with that obligation, the Authority may direct that that gold or currency shall vest in the Authority, and it shall vest in the Authority accordingly free from any mortgage, pledge or charge. (7) The Authority may deal with any gold or specified currency vested in the Authority under subsection (6) as it thinks fit, but the Authority shall pay to the person who would but for the direction be entitled to the gold or currency such sum as he would have received therefor if he had sold it to an authorised dealer in pursuance of an offer made under this section at the time when the vesting occurred. (8) In any proceedings in respect of a failure to comply with this section, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that the gold or currency in question has not been offered for sale to an authorised dealer."

(2) For the purposes of any provision of this Part prohibiting the transfer of securities, a person shall be deemed to transfer a security if he executes any instrument of transfer thereof, whether effective or not, and shall be deemed to transfer it at the place where he executes the instrument. (3) References in this Part to the person holding a certificate of title or coupon shall be construed as references to the person having physical custody of the certificate of title or coupon. (4) Where the certificate of title or coupon referred to in subsection (3) is deposited with any person in a locked or sealed receptacle from which he is not entitled to remove it without the authority of some other person, that other person shall be deemed for the purposes of this Part to have the physical custody thereof.

[21/2008] (6) The holder of a security or coupon shall be deemed for the purposes of this Part to be a nominee in respect thereof if, as respects the exercise of any rights in respect thereof, he is not entitled to exercise those rights except in accordance with instructions given by some other person. (7) References in this Part to the person for whom the holder of a security or coupon is a nominee shall be construed as references to the person who is entitled to give instructions, either directly or through the agency of one or more persons, as to the exercise of any rights in respect of the security or coupon and is not in so doing himself under a duty to comply with instructions given by some other person. (8) A person shall not by reason only that he has a controlling interest in a body corporate be deemed for the purposes of subsection (6) to be entitled to give instructions to that body corporate as to the exercise of rights in respect of any security or coupon of which it is the holder. (9) A person shall not be deemed to hold a security or coupon as a nominee by reason only that he holds it as trustee if he is entitled to transfer the security or coupon without permission from any other person. (10) A certificate of title shall not for the purposes of this Part be treated as in the custody of an authorised depositary if either — ( a ) the depositary has no notice of the nature of the certificate; or ( b ) the certificate is deposited with him in a locked or sealed receptacle from which he is not entitled to remove it without the authority of some other person. (11) Where a certificate of title outside Singapore is by this Part required to be kept in the custody of an authorised depositary, it shall be deemed to be in the custody of an authorised depositary if — ( a ) by his direction or with his assent it is in the custody of some other person who holds it on behalf of and to the order of the authorised depositary; and ( b ) the certificate is not deposited with that other person in a locked or sealed receptacle from which he is not entitled to remove it without the authority of a person other than himself. (12) Where a certificate of title is by virtue of subsection (11) deemed to be in the custody of an authorised depositary, references in this Part to the depositary parting with the certificate or a coupon belonging thereto shall be construed as references to his permitting the person having the actual custody thereof to part with it otherwise than to the depositary, and references to his destroying the certificate or such a coupon shall be construed as references to his permitting it to be destroyed."
