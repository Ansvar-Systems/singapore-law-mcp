(2) If at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the court that P has no sufficient property and that no person legally bound to maintain P has sufficient means for the payment of the cost, the court is to so certify instead of making an order under that subsection for the payment of the cost. (3) An order under subsection (1) is to be enforced in the same manner and has the same force and effect and is subject to the same appeal as a judgment or order made by the court in a suit in respect of the property or person mentioned in that subsection."
