[36/2014] (2) A security interest in book‑entry securities to secure the payment of a debt or liability may be created in favour of any depositor in the following manner: ( a ) by way of assignment, by an instrument of assignment in the prescribed form executed by the assignor; ( b ) by way of charge, by an instrument of charge in the prescribed form executed by the chargor, if no security interest in any book‑entry securities subsequent to any assignment or charge thereof may be created by the assignor or the chargor (as the case may be) in favour of any other person and any such assignment or charge is void. [36/2014] (3) Upon receipt of the instrument of assignment, the Depository must immediately, by way of an off‑market transaction, transfer the book‑entry securities to the assignee and thereafter notify the assignor and the assignee of the transfer in the prescribed manner. [36/2014] (4) Upon receipt of the instrument of charge, the Depository must immediately register the instrument in a register of charges maintained by the Depository and thereafter notify the chargor and the chargee in the prescribed manner. [36/2014] (5) The register of charges is not open to inspection to any person other than the chargor or the chargee or their authorised representatives and except for the purpose of the performance of its duties or the exercise of its functions or when required to do so by any court or under the provisions of any written law, the Depository must not disclose to any unauthorised person any information contained in the register of charges. [36/2014] (6) An assignment or a charge made in accordance with the provisions of this section, but not otherwise, has effect upon the Depository transferring the book‑entry securities or endorsing the charge in the register of charges except that, where the instrument of assignment or charge specifies the number of book‑entry securities to which the assignment or charge relates, the instrument of assignment or charge does not have any effect if on the date of receipt of such instrument, the number of book‑entry securities in the account of the assignor or chargor is less than the number of book‑entry securities specified in such instrument. [36/2014; 4/2017] (7) The provisions of section 81SJ(1), (2) and (3) apply to an assignment of book‑entry securities made under this section. [36/2014] (8) An assignee or a registered chargee of book‑entry securities has the following powers: ( a ) a power, when the loan or liability has become due and payable, to sell the book‑entry securities or any part thereof and in the case of a chargee, the chargee has the power to sell the book‑entry securities or any part thereof in the name of and for and on behalf of the chargor; ( b ) any other power which may be granted to the assignee or registered chargee in writing by the assignor or chargor in relation to the book‑entry securities provided that the Depository is not concerned with or affected by the exercise of any such power. [36/2014] (9) Nothing in subsection (8) is to be construed as imposing on the Depository a duty to ascertain whether the power of sale has become exercisable or has been lawfully exercised by the assignee or chargee. [36/2014] (10) No book‑entry securities assigned by way of security or charged in accordance with the provisions of this section may be — ( a ) transferred by way of an off‑market transaction to the assignor except upon the production of a duly executed re‑assignment in the prescribed form; or ( b ) transferred by the chargor, by way of sale or otherwise, except — (i) upon the production of a duly executed discharge of charge in the prescribed form; or (ii) upon the return of such book‑entry securities to the chargor’s control with the approval in writing of the chargee. [36/2014; 4/2017] (10A) A charge on book‑entry securities made in accordance with the provisions of this section is treated as discharged if such book‑entry securities have been returned to the chargor’s control with the approval in writing of the chargee. [4/2017] (11) Upon the sale by the assignee or the chargee in exercise of the assignee’s or chargee’s power of sale of any book‑entry securities assigned or charged in accordance with the provisions of this section, the assignee or the chargee must immediately notify the Depository of the sale and the particulars of the book‑entry securities sold by the assignee or chargee, and the Depository must — ( a ) in the case of the sale by the assignee, notify the assignor of the sale; and ( b ) in the case of the sale by the chargee, effect a transfer of the book‑entry securities to the buyer in accordance with section 81SM and notify the chargor of the transfer, and the provisions of sections 81SO, 81SP and 81SR apply, with the necessary modifications, to a transfer effected pursuant to this section. [36/2014] (12) Upon fulfilling the assignor’s or the chargor’s obligations under an assignment by way of security or a charge, the assignor or the chargor is entitled to obtain from the assignee or chargee a re‑assignment or a discharge of charge (as the case may be) of the whole or part of the book‑entry securities. [36/2014] (13) A re‑assignment or discharge of charge is to be effected by the Depository by transferring the book‑entry securities to the assignor or cancelling the endorsement of charge in the register of charges and in the chargor’s account, as the case may be. [36/2014] (14) Book‑entry securities may be assigned by way of security by an assignee or charged in the prescribed form by a chargee to secure the payment of any debt or liability of the assignee or the chargee (as the case may be) in accordance with the provisions of this section provided that no book‑entry security may be charged by a chargee subsequent to any sub‑charge. [36/2014] (15) All acts, powers and rights which might previously have been done or exercised by the chargee thereunder in relation to the book‑entry securities may thereafter be done or exercised by the sub‑chargee, and, except with the consent of the sub‑chargee, must not be done or exercised by the chargee thereunder during the currency of the sub‑charge. [36/2014] (16) Upon the sale by the sub‑chargee in exercise of the sub‑chargee’s power of sale of any book‑entry securities in accordance with the provisions of this section, the provisions of subsection (11), in respect of a sale by a chargee, apply with the necessary modifications to the sale by the sub‑chargee. [36/2014] (17) Nothing in subsection (14) affects the rights or liabilities of the original assignor or chargor of the book‑entry securities under subsections (12) and (13) and the original assignor or chargor is entitled to a re‑assignment or discharge of charge from the assignee or chargee free from all subsequent security interests created without the original assignor’s or chargor’s consent upon satisfying the original assignor’s or chargor’s indebtedness or liability to the assignee or the chargee. [36/2014] (18) The provisions of section 81SN apply to relieve the Depository and its servants or agents of any liability in respect of any act done or omission made under this section as if references to depositor include references to assignee, chargee or sub‑chargee, as the case may be. [36/2014] (19) Nothing in this section affects the validity and operation of floating charges on book‑entry securities created under the common law before or after 12 November 1993, but the Depository is not required to recognise, even when having notice thereof, any equitable interest in any book‑entry securities under a floating charge except the power of the chargee, upon the crystallisation of the floating charge, to sell the book‑entry securities in the name of the chargor in accordance with the provisions of this section. [36/2014] (20) Nothing in subsection (19) is to be construed as imposing on the Depository a duty to ascertain whether the power of sale pursuant to a floating charge has become exercisable or has been lawfully exercised. [36/2014] (21) A member of SGX‑ST has a lien over the unpaid book‑entry securities purchased for the account of its customer which is enforceable by sale in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section as if the same had been charged to the member under this section, except that the member is not obliged to notify the Depository of the sale or the particulars of the book‑entry securities sold by the member. [36/2014] (22) Any security interest on book‑entry securities created before 12 November 1993 and subsisting or in force on that date continues to have effect as if the Companies (Amendment) Act 1993 had not been enacted. [36/2014] (23) In this section, “off‑market transaction” means a transaction effected outside the SGX‑ST. [36/2014]"

[4/2017] (8) Any authorised benchmark administrator or exempt benchmark administrator which contravenes subsection (1), (2), (3) or (5) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $150,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $15,000 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.

[4/2017] (10) Despite subsection (6), a failure of any authorised benchmark submitter, exempt benchmark submitter or designated benchmark submitter to comply with a code on designated benchmark does not of itself render that authorised benchmark submitter, exempt benchmark submitter or designated benchmark submitter (as the case may be) liable to criminal proceedings but any such failure may be relied upon by any party in any proceedings (whether civil or criminal) as tending to establish or negate any liability which is in question in those proceedings.

(2) For the more effective administration, supervision and control of take‑over offers and matters connected therewith, the Authority is to, on the advice of the Securities Industry Council and under section 321, issue a code known as the Singapore Code on Take‑overs and Mergers (called in this Act the Take‑over Code). (3) To avoid doubt, the Take‑over Code is deemed not to be subsidiary legislation. (4) The Take‑over Code applies to a take‑over offer and to matters connected therewith, and all parties concerned in a take‑over offer or a matter connected therewith must comply with its provisions. (5) The Take‑over Code is administered and enforced by the Securities Industry Council. (6) The Authority may, on the advice of the Securities Industry Council, revise the Take‑over Code by deleting, amending or adding to the provisions thereof. (7) The Securities Industry Council may issue rulings on the interpretation of the general principles and rules in the Take‑over Code and lay down the practice to be followed by parties concerned in a take‑over offer or a matter connected therewith, and such rulings or practice is final. (8) A failure of any party concerned in a take‑over offer or a matter connected therewith to observe any of the provisions of the Take‑over Code does not of itself render that party liable to criminal proceedings but any such failure may, in any proceedings whether civil or criminal, be relied upon by any party to the proceedings as tending to establish or to negate any liability which is in question in the proceedings. (9) Nothing in subsection (8) is to be construed as preventing the Securities Industry Council from invoking such sanctions (including public censure) as it may decide in relation to breaches of the Take‑over Code by any party concerned in a take‑over offer or a matter connected therewith. (10) Where the Securities Industry Council has reason to believe that any party concerned in a take‑over offer or a matter connected therewith, or any person advising on a take‑over offer or a matter connected therewith, is in breach of the provisions of the Take‑over Code or is otherwise believed to have committed acts of misconduct in relation to such take‑over offer or matter, the Securities Industry Council has power to enquire into the suspected breach or misconduct. (11) For the purpose of subsection (10), the Securities Industry Council may summon any person to give evidence on oath or affirmation, which it is authorised to administer, or produce any document or material necessary for the purpose of the enquiry."

[4/2017] (4A) To avoid doubt, this section, and section 150C in relation to an inspection under this section, do not apply to any inspection by a foreign regulatory authority of the books of any person, if — ( a ) the foreign regulatory authority is an AML/CFT authority as defined in section 17 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022, and exercises consolidated supervision authority as defined in that section over that person; and [Act 18 of 2022 wef 28/04/2023] ( b ) the inspection is solely for the purpose of such consolidated supervision.

[4/2017] (10E) To avoid doubt, no action or proceedings of any kind may be brought by or on behalf of all or any of the participants of an authorised real estate investment trust against a director of the manager of that authorised real estate investment trust for any breach or alleged breach of the duties imposed by subsection (10B) except to the extent and in the manner provided for under section 295C. [4/2017] (11) Despite subsection (10), a failure by any person to comply with the Code on Collective Investment Schemes does not of itself render that person liable to criminal proceedings but such failure may, in any proceedings whether civil or criminal, be relied upon by any party to the proceedings as tending to establish or to negate any liability which is in question in the proceedings. (12) If any person fails to comply with the Code on Collective Investment Schemes, the Authority may, in addition to, or as an alternative to any action under section 288, take such other action as it deems fit. (13) The responsible person for a collective investment scheme which is authorised under subsection (1) must provide such information or record regarding the scheme as the Authority may, at any time, require for the proper administration of this Act.

[2/2009] (2) When a notice referred to in subsection (1) is given, the transferee, unless on an application made by a dissenting participant within one month from the date on which the notice was given or within 14 days of a statement being supplied to a dissenting participant under subsection (3) (whichever is the later) a court thinks fit to order otherwise, is entitled and bound to acquire those units — ( a ) on the terms which under the arrangement or contract the units of the approving participants are to be transferred to the transferee; or ( b ) if the offer contained 2 or more alternative sets of terms, on the terms which were specified in the offer as being applicable to dissenting participants.
