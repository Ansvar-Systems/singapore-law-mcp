[38/2018] (14) Where any vehicle which has been removed and detained or to which an immobilisation device has been fixed in accordance with this section is not earlier forfeited under this section and is not claimed by its owner within one month of the date of its detention or immobilisation, the Superintendent or an authorised officer or enforcement officer may, after giving one month’s notice in the Gazette of his or her intention to do so, sell the vehicle by public auction or otherwise dispose of the vehicle in any manner as he or she thinks fit.
