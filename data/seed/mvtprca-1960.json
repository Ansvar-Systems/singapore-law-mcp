      "content": "10. —(1) Where under any policy issued for the purposes of this Act a person (called in this Act the insured) is insured against liabilities to third parties which the insured may incur then — ( a ) in the event of the insured becoming bankrupt or making a composition or arrangement with the insured’s creditors; or ( b ) in the case of the insured being a company in the event of — (i) a winding up order being made or a resolution for a voluntary winding up being passed with respect to the company; (ii) a receiver or manager of the company’s business or undertaking being duly appointed; or (iii) possession being taken by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by a floating charge of any property comprised in or subject to the charge, if either before or after that event any such liability as aforesaid is incurred by the insured the insured’s rights against the insurer under the policy in respect of the liability are, despite anything in any written law to the contrary, to be transferred to and vest in the third party to whom the liability was so incurred. (2) Where an order is made under section 419 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 for the administration in bankruptcy of the estate of a deceased debtor then if any debt provable in bankruptcy is owing by the deceased in respect of a liability against which he or she was insured under a policy issued for the purposes of this Act as being a liability to a third party the deceased debtor’s rights against the insurer under the policy in respect of that liability are, despite anything in the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018, to be transferred to and vest in the person to whom the debt is owing. [40/2018] (3) Any condition in a policy issued for the purposes of this Act purporting, directly or indirectly, to avoid the policy or to alter the rights of the party under the policy upon the happening to the insured of any of the events specified in subsection (1)( a ) or ( b ) or upon the making of an order under section 419 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 in respect of his or her estate is of no effect. [40/2018] (4) Upon a transfer under subsection (1) or (2), the insurer is, subject to section 12, under the same liability to the third party as the insurer would have been under to the insured but — ( a ) if the liability of the insurer to the insured exceeds the liability of the insured to the third party, nothing in this Act affects the rights of the insured against the insurer in respect of the excess; and ( b ) if the liability of the insurer to the insured is less than the liability of the insured to the third party, nothing in this Act affects the rights of the third party against the insured in respect of the balance. (5) For the purposes of this section and sections 11 and 12, the expression “liabilities to third parties” in relation to a person insured under any policy of insurance does not include any liability of that person in the capacity of insurer under some other policy of insurance. (6) This section and sections 11 and 12 do not apply — ( a ) where a company is wound up voluntarily merely for the purposes of reconstruction or of amalgamation with another company; or ( b ) to any case to which section 28(1), (2) and (3) of the Work Injury Compensation Act 2019, or section 19(1), (1A) and (2) of the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap. 354, 2009 Revised Edition) repealed by the Work Injury Compensation Act 2019, applies.

(4) If the information given to any person under subsection (2) discloses reasonable ground for supposing that there have or may have been transferred to the person under this Act rights against any particular insurer, that insurer is subject to the same duty as is imposed by that subsection on the persons mentioned in that subsection. (5) The duty to give information imposed by this section includes a duty to allow all contracts of insurance, receipts for premiums and other relevant documents in the possession or power of the person on whom the duty is so imposed to be inspected and copies thereof to be taken.
