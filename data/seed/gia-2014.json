(7) The Registrar may, in the Registrar’s discretion, register any geographical indication referred to in subsection (4) or (6), if the proprietor of the trade mark referred to in subsection (4) or (6), as the case may be — ( a ) consents to the registration; or ( b ) fails to give notice to the Registrar of the proprietor’s opposition to the registration in accordance with section 45(2). (8) To avoid doubt — ( a ) a reference to a geographical indication in this section includes a variant constituting a geographical indication; and ( b ) a refusal of registration under this section of any variant constituting a geographical indication does not prevent the registration of any other variant constituting the geographical indication, if that other variant satisfies the requirements of this Act.
