[36/2014] (2) Subsection (1) does not apply where the subsidiary is concerned as personal representative, or where it is concerned as trustee, unless the holding company or a subsidiary thereof is beneficially interested under the trust and is not so interested only by way of security for the purposes of a transaction entered into by it in the ordinary course of a business which includes the lending of money. (3) This section does not prevent a subsidiary which, on 29 December 1967, is a member of its holding company, from continuing to be a member but, subject to subsection (2), the subsidiary has no right to vote at meetings of the holding company or any class of members thereof. (4) This section does not prevent a subsidiary from continuing to be a member of its holding company if, at the time when it becomes a subsidiary of the holding company, it already holds shares in that holding company, but — ( a ) subject to subsection (2), the subsidiary has no right to vote at meetings of the holding company or any class of members thereof; and ( b ) subject to subsections (4A) and (4B), the subsidiary must, within the period of 12 months or such longer period as the Court may allow after becoming the subsidiary of its holding company, dispose of all of its shares in the holding company.

[36/2014] (6E) With respect to any share referred to in subsection (4B) or (6C) — ( a ) where the holding company has shares of only one class, the aggregate number of shares held by all the subsidiaries of the holding company under subsection (4B) or (6C) or by the holding company as treasury shares, must not at any time exceed 10% of the total number of shares of the holding company at that time; ( b ) where the share capital of the holding company is divided into shares of different classes, the aggregate number of the shares of any class held by all the subsidiaries of the holding company under subsection (4B) or (6C) or by the holding company as treasury shares, must not at any time exceed 10% of the total number of the shares in that class of the holding company at that time; ( c ) where paragraph ( a ) or ( b ) is contravened, the holding company must dispose of or cancel the excess shares, or procure the disposal of the excess shares by its subsidiary, in accordance with section 76K before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the day on which that contravention occurs, or such further period as the Registrar may allow; ( d ) where the subsidiary is a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the holding company, no dividend may be paid, and no other distribution (whether in cash or otherwise) of the holding company’s assets (including any distribution of assets to members on a winding up) may be made, to the subsidiary in respect of the shares referred to in subsection (4B) or (6C); and ( e ) where the subsidiary is not a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the holding company, a dividend may be paid and other distribution (whether in cash or otherwise) of the holding company’s assets (including any distribution of assets to members on a winding up) may be made, to the subsidiary in respect of the shares referred to in subsection (4B) or (6C). [36/2014] (6F) In subsection (6E)( c ), “excess shares” means such number of the shares, held by any subsidiary under subsection (4B) or (6C) or by the holding company as treasury shares at the time in question, as resulted in the limit referred to in subsection (6E)( a ) or ( b ) being exceeded.

[36/2014; 40/2018] (7) Where but for this section a subsidiary would have been entitled to subscribe for shares in the holding company, the holding company may, on behalf of the subsidiary, sell the shares for which the subsidiary would otherwise have been entitled to subscribe. (8) In relation to a holding company that is a company limited by guarantee, the reference in this section to shares is to be read as including a reference to the interest of its members as such, whatever the form of that interest. (9) For the purposes of this section, a company must inform the Registrar of the occurrence of any of the following events by lodging a notice in the prescribed form within 14 days after the date of occurrence: ( a ) where a shareholder of a company that is a corporation becomes a subsidiary of the company; ( b ) where shares of the company are held by a subsidiary of the company and there is a change in the number of shares held by the subsidiary.

[36/2014] (12C) A person aggrieved by a decision of the Registrar — ( a ) refusing to approve an application under subsection (10); or ( b ) refusing an application under subsection (12B)( a ) to extend the reservation period, may, within 30 days after being informed of the Registrar’s decision, appeal to the Minister whose decision is final.

[36/2014] (14) [ Deleted by Act 36 of 2014 ] (15) The reservation of a name under this section in respect of an intended company or company does not in itself entitle the intended company or company to be registered by that name, either originally or upon change of name. [36/2014] (16) In this section and section 28, “registered business name” has the meaning given by section 2(1) of the Business Names Registration Act 2014. [36/2014]"

(2) Prior to ratification by the company the person or persons who purported to act in the name or on behalf of the company are, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, personally bound by the contract or other transaction and entitled to the benefit thereof. Form of contract (3) Contracts on behalf of a corporation may be made as follows: ( a ) a contract which if made between private persons would by law be required to be in writing under seal may be made on behalf of the corporation in writing under the common seal of the corporation; ( b ) a contract which if made between private persons would by law be required to be in writing signed by the parties to be charged therewith may be made on behalf of the corporation in writing signed by any person acting under its authority, express or implied; ( c ) a contract which if made between private persons would by law be valid although made by parol only (and not reduced into writing) may be made by parol on behalf of the corporation by any person acting under its authority, express or implied, and any contract so made is effectual in law and binds the corporation and its successors and all other parties thereto and may be varied or discharged in the manner in which it is authorised to be made. Authentication of documents (4) A document or proceeding requiring authentication by a corporation may be signed by an authorised officer of the corporation and need not be under its common seal. Execution of deeds (5) A corporation may by writing under its common seal empower any person, either generally or in respect of any specified matters, as its agent or attorney to execute deeds on its behalf and a deed signed by such an agent or attorney on behalf of the corporation and under his or her seal, or, subject to subsection (7), under the appropriate official seal of the corporation binds the corporation and has the same effect as if it were under its common seal. (6) The authority of any such agent or attorney continues, as between the corporation and any person dealing with him or her, during the period (if any) mentioned in the instrument conferring the authority, or if no period is therein mentioned then until notice of the revocation or determination of his or her authority has been given to the person dealing with him or her. Official seal for use abroad (7) A corporation whose objects require or comprise the transaction of business outside Singapore may, if authorised by its constitution, have for use in any place outside Singapore an official seal, which must be a facsimile of the common seal of the corporation with the addition on its face of the name of the place where it is to be used and the person affixing any such official seal must, in writing under his or her hand, certify on the instrument to which it is affixed the date on which and the place at which it is affixed.

[36/2014] (13) The power of a Court under section 391 to relieve a person to whom that section applies, wholly or partly and on such terms as the Court thinks fit, from a liability mentioned in that section extends to relieving a person against whom an order may be made under subsection (4) from the liability to have such an order made against the person. (14) If a company makes a contract or engages in a transaction under which it gives financial assistance as mentioned in section 76(1) or lends money as mentioned in section 76(1A)( b ), any contract or transaction made or engaged in as a result of or by means of, or in relation to, that financial assistance or money is deemed for the purposes of this section to be related to the firstmentioned contract or transaction. [36/2014] (15) Any rights or liabilities of a person under this section (including rights or liabilities under an order made by the Court under this section) are in addition to and not in derogation of any rights or liabilities of that person apart from this section but, where there would be any inconsistency between the rights and liabilities of a person under this section or under an order made by the Court under this section and the rights and liabilities of that person apart from this section, the provisions of this section or of the order made by the Court prevails."

[36/2014] (1A) In connection with the registration of a charge to which this section applies which is created by a company there must be produced to the Registrar, upon the Registrar’s request and for the purposes of inspection, at no cost to the Registrar, the instrument (if any) by which the charge is created or evidenced or a certified true copy thereof. (2) Nothing in subsection (1) affects any contract or obligation for repayment of the money secured by a charge and when a charge becomes void under this section the money secured thereby immediately becomes payable. (3) This section applies to the following charges that are created on or after 3 January 2016: ( a ) a charge to secure any issue of debentures; ( b ) a charge on uncalled share capital of a company; ( c ) a charge on shares of a subsidiary of a company which are owned by the company; ( d ) a charge created or evidenced by an instrument which if executed by an individual, would require registration as a bill of sale; ( e ) a charge on land wherever situate or any interest therein but not including any charge for any rent or other periodical sum issuing out of land; ( f ) a charge on book debts of the company; ( g ) a floating charge on the undertaking or property of a company; ( h ) a charge on calls made but not paid; ( i ) a charge on a ship or aircraft or any share in a ship or aircraft; ( j ) a charge on goodwill, on a patent or a licence under a patent, on a trade mark or a licence to use a trademark, or on a copyright or a licence under a copyright or on a registered design or a licence to use a registered design. [36/2014] (3AA) This section also applies to any charge that — ( a ) was a charge to which this section applied under subsection (3) in force immediately before 3 January 2016; and ( b ) was created before that date. [36/2014] (3AB) Despite subsection (3), a shipowner’s lien created by a company on or after 1 October 2018, whether as a charge on book debts of the company or a floating charge on the undertaking or property of the company, is not a charge to which this section applies. [35/2018] (3AC) Despite subsection (3) or (3AA), a shipowner’s lien created by a company before 1 October 2018, whether as a charge on book debts of the company or a floating charge on the undertaking or property of the company, is a charge to which this section applies only if, as at that date — ( a ) an order for the winding up of the company has been made; ( b ) a resolution has been passed for the voluntary winding up of the company; or ( c ) a creditor of the company has acquired a proprietary right to or an interest in the subject matter of the lien. [35/2018] (3A) The reference to a charge on book debts in subsection (3)( f ) does not include a reference to a charge on a negotiable instrument or on debentures issued by the Government. (3B) A charge mentioned in subsection (3) does not include a charge created at any time on or after 1 May 2009 to the extent that it is capable of being registered under the International Interests in Aircraft Equipment Act 2009. [5/2009] (3C) In subsection (3B), “registered” has the meaning given by section 2(1) of the International Interests in Aircraft Equipment Act 2009.

(11) In this section, “shipowner’s lien” means a contractual lien on — ( a ) sub‑freights; ( b ) sub‑hires; or ( c ) bill of lading freight, created under a charter (or sub‑charter) of a ship for any amount due under the charter (or sub‑charter).

      "content": "149. —(1) The Court may — ( a ) on the application of the Minister or the Official Receiver as provided for in subsection (9); and ( b ) on being satisfied as to the matters referred to in subsection (2), make an order disqualifying a person specified in the order from being a director or in any way, whether directly or indirectly, being concerned in, or taking part in, the management of a company, during such period not exceeding 5 years after the date of the order as is specified in the order (called in this section a disqualification order). (2) The Court must make a disqualification order under subsection (1) if it is satisfied that — ( a ) the person against whom the order is sought has been given not less than 14 days’ notice of the application; and ( b ) in respect of the person — (i) he or she is or has been a director of a company which has at any time gone into liquidation (whether while he or she was a director or within 3 years of his or her ceasing to be a director) and was insolvent at that time; and (ii) his or her conduct as director of that company either taken alone or taken together with his or her conduct as a director of any other company or companies makes him or her unfit to be a director of or in any way, whether directly or indirectly, be concerned in, or take part in, the management of a company. (3) If in the case of a person who is or has been a director of a company which is — ( a ) being wound up by the Court, it appears to the Official Receiver or to the liquidator (if the liquidator is not the Official Receiver); or ( b ) being wound up otherwise than as mentioned in paragraph ( a ), it appears to the liquidator, that the conditions mentioned in subsection (2)( b ) are satisfied as respects that person, the Official Receiver or the liquidator (as the case may be) must immediately report the matter to the Minister. (4) The Minister may require the Official Receiver or the liquidator or the former liquidator of a company — ( a ) to furnish the Minister with such information with respect to any person’s conduct as a director of the company; and ( b ) to produce and permit inspection of such books, papers and other records relevant to that person’s conduct as such a director, as the Minister may reasonably require for the purpose of determining whether to exercise, or of exercising, any of the Minister’s functions under this section; and if default is made in complying with that requirement the Court may, on the application of the Minister, make an order requiring that person to make good the default within such time as is specified in the order. (5) For the purposes of this section — ( a ) a company has gone into liquidation — (i) if it is wound up by the Court, on the date of the filing of the winding up application; (ii) where a provisional liquidator was appointed under section 161(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018, at the time when the declaration made under that subsection was lodged with the Registrar; and (iii) in any other case, on the date of the passing of the resolution for the voluntary winding up; and ( b ) a company was insolvent at the time it has gone into liquidation if it was unable to pay its debts, within the meaning of that expression in section 125(2) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018, and references in this section to a person’s conduct as a director of any company or companies include, where any of those companies have become insolvent, references to that person’s conduct in relation to any matter connected with or arising out of the insolvency of that company. [40/2018] (6) In deciding whether a person’s conduct as a director of any particular company or companies makes him or her unfit to be concerned in, or take part in, the management of a company as is mentioned in subsection (2)( b ), the Court must in relation to his or her conduct as a director of that company or (as the case may be) each of those companies have regard, generally to the matters referred to in paragraph ( a ), and, in particular, to the matters referred to in paragraph ( b ), even though the director has not been convicted or may be criminally liable in respect of any of these matters — ( a ) as to — (i) whether there has been any misfeasance or breach of any fiduciary or other duty by the director in relation to the company; (ii) whether there has been any misapplication or retention by the director of, or any conduct by the director giving rise to an obligation to account for, any money or other property of the company; (iii) the extent of the director’s responsibility for any failure by the company to comply with sections 138, 190, 191, 196B, 197, 199 and 201; and ( b ) as to — (i) the extent of the director’s responsibility for the causes of the company becoming insolvent; (ii) the extent of the director’s responsibility for any failure by the company to supply any goods or services which have been paid for (in whole or in part); (iii) the extent of the director’s responsibility for the company entering into any transaction liable to be set aside under section 130(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018; (iv) whether the causes of the company becoming insolvent are attributable to its carrying on business in a particular industry where the risk of insolvency is generally recognised to be higher. [36/2014; 40/2018] (7) The Minister may, by notification in the Gazette , add to, vary or amend the matters referred to in subsection (6) and that notification may contain such transitional provisions as may appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient. (8) In this section, “company” includes a corporation and a foreign company but does not include a partnership or association to which Division 1 of Part 10 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 applies. [40/2018] (9) In the case of a person who is or has been a director of a company which has gone into liquidation and is being wound up by the Court, an application under this section is to be made by the Official Receiver but in any other case an application is to be made by the Minister. (9A) On a hearing of an application under this section — ( a ) the Minister or the Official Receiver (as the case may be) must appear and call the attention of the Court to any matter which appears to him or her to be relevant (and for this purpose the Minister may be represented) and may give evidence or call witnesses; and ( b ) the person against whom an order is sought may appear and himself or herself give evidence or call witnesses. (10) This section does not apply unless the company mentioned in subsection (2)( b ) has gone into insolvent liquidation on or after 15 August 1984 and the conduct to which the Court is to have regard does not include conduct as a director of a company that has gone into liquidation before that date. (11) A person who acts as judicial manager, receiver or receiver manager shall not be liable to have a disqualification order made against the person in respect of acts done in the person’s capacity as judicial manager, receiver or receiver manager, as the case may be. (12) Any person who acts in contravention of a disqualification order made under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. (13) Nothing in this section prevents a person who is disqualified pursuant to an order made under subsection (1) from applying for permission of the Court to be concerned in or take part in the management of a company. [Act 25 of 2021 wef 01/04/2022] (14) On the hearing of an application made under subsection (13) or (15), the Minister or the Official Receiver must appear (and for this purpose the Minister may be represented) and call attention of the Court to any matter which appears to him or her to be relevant to the application and may himself or herself give evidence or call witnesses. (15) Any right to apply for permission of the Court to be concerned or take part in the management of a company that was subsisting immediately before 23 March 1990 is, after that date, to be treated as subsisting by virtue of the corresponding provision made under this section.

[36/2014] (3) Where notice is given pursuant to subsection (2) and the director concerned makes with respect thereto representations in writing to the public company, not exceeding a reasonable length, and requests their notification to members of the company, the company must, unless the representations are received by it too late for it to do so — ( a ) in any notice of the resolution given to members of the company state the fact of the representations having been made; and ( b ) send a copy of the representations to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is sent, whether before or after receipt of the representations by the company, and if a copy of the representations is not so sent because they were received too late or because of the company’s default the director may, without affecting the director’s right to be heard orally, require that the representations must be read out at the meeting. [36/2014] (4) Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need not be read out at the meeting if, on the application either of the public company or of any other person who claims to be aggrieved, the Court is satisfied that the rights conferred by this section are being abused to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter and the Court may order the company’s costs on an application under this section to be paid in whole or in part by the director, even though the director is not a party to the application.

[36/2014] (1A) It is the duty of the directors of a company to take all reasonable steps to secure that each secretary of the company is a person who appears to them to have the requisite knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of secretary of the company. (1AA) In addition, it is the duty of the directors of a public company to take all reasonable steps to secure that each secretary of the company is a person who — ( a ) on 15 May 1987 held the office of secretary in that company and continued to hold that office on 15 May 2003; or ( b ) satisfies such requirements relating to experience, professional and academic requirements and membership of professional associations, as may be prescribed. [36/2014] (1AB) The Registrar may require a private company to appoint a person who satisfies subsection (1AA)( b ) as its secretary if the Registrar is satisfied that the company has failed to comply with any provision of this Act with respect to the keeping of any register or other record. [36/2014] (1B) Any person who is appointed by the directors of a company as a secretary must, at the time of his or her appointment, by himself or herself or through a registered qualified individual authorised by him or her, file with the Registrar a declaration in the prescribed form that he or she consents to act as secretary and providing the prescribed particulars. [36/2014] (1C) A person to whom subsection (1AA)( a ) applies who, after 15 May 1987, becomes a secretary of another company and is not qualified to act as secretary under subsection (1AA)( b ) is not to be regarded as being a person who is qualified to discharge the functions of secretary under this subsection. [36/2014] (1D) In this section and sections 173 to 173I, “secretary” includes an assistant or deputy secretary. [36/2014] (1E) Where a director is the sole director of a company, he or she must not act or be appointed as the secretary of the company. (2) Subsection (1) does not operate to prevent a corporation which was acting as the secretary of a company immediately before 29 December 1967 from continuing to act as secretary of that company for a period of 12 months after that date. (3) The secretary or secretaries are to be appointed by the directors and at least one of those secretaries must be present at the registered office of the company by himself or herself or his or her agent or clerk on the days and at the hours during which the registered office is to be accessible to the public. (3A) Despite subsection (3), a secretary or his or her agent or clerk of a private company need not be physically present at the registered office during the times specified in that subsection if a secretary or his or her agent or clerk of the private company is readily contactable by a person at the registered office by telephone or other means of instantaneous communication during those times. [36/2014] (4) Subject to subsection (4A), anything required or authorised to be done by or in relation to the secretary may, if the office is vacant or for any other reason the secretary is not capable of acting, be done by or in relation to any assistant or deputy secretary or, if there is no assistant or deputy secretary capable of acting, by or in relation to any officer of the company authorised generally or specially in that behalf by the directors. (4A) The office of secretary must not be left vacant for more than 6 months at any one time. (5) A provision requiring or authorising a thing to be done by or in relation to a director and the secretary is not satisfied by its being done by or in relation to the same person acting both as director and as, or in place of, the secretary."

[36/2014] (3) Any person who authorises or permits an invitation to appoint as proxy a person or one of a number of persons specified in the invitation to be issued at the company’s expense to some only of the members entitled to be sent a notice of the meeting and to vote thereat by proxy shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000. (4) No person shall be guilty of an offence under subsection (3) by reason only of the issue to a member at the member’s request of a form of appointment naming the proxy or a list of persons willing to act as proxies if the form or list is available on request in writing to every member entitled to vote at the meeting by proxy. (5) Any person who authorises or permits an invitation to appoint as proxy a person or one of a number of persons specified in the invitation to be issued or circulated shall be guilty of an offence unless the invitation is accompanied by a form of proxy which entitles the member to direct the proxy to vote either for or against the resolution. (6) In this section, “relevant intermediary” means — ( a ) a banking corporation licensed under the Banking Act 1970 or a wholly‑owned subsidiary of such a banking corporation, whose business includes the provision of nominee services and who holds shares in that capacity; ( b ) a person holding a capital markets services licence to provide custodial services under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and who holds shares in that capacity; or ( c ) the Central Provident Fund Board established by the Central Provident Fund Act 1953, in respect of shares purchased under the subsidiary legislation made under that Act providing for the making of investments from the contributions and interest standing to the credit of members of the Central Provident Fund, if the Board holds those shares in the capacity of an intermediary pursuant to or in accordance with that subsidiary legislation.

(12) For the purposes of subsection (9A)( d ), a body corporate is controlled by a transferee or person mentioned in paragraph ( a ), ( b ) or ( c ) of subsection (9A) if — ( a ) the transferee or person (as the case may be) is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of not less than 50% of the voting power in the body corporate or such percentage of the voting power in the body corporate as may be prescribed, whichever is lower; or ( b ) the body corporate is, or a majority of its directors are, accustomed or under an obligation whether formal or informal to act "

(2) The appointment of an inspector under this section may define the scope of the inspector’s investigation, whether as respects the matters or the period to which it is to extend or otherwise, and in particular may limit the investigation to matters connected with particular shares or debentures. (3) Where an application for an investigation under this section with respect to particular shares or debentures of a corporation is made to the Minister by members of the corporation, and the number of applicants or the amount of the shares held by them is not less than that required for an application for the appointment of an inspector under section 232, the Minister must appoint an inspector to conduct the investigation unless the Minister is satisfied that the application is vexatious, and the inspector’s appointment must not exclude from the scope of the inspector’s investigation any matter which the application seeks to have included therein, except insofar as the Minister is satisfied that it is unreasonable for that matter to be investigated.

[Act 21 of 2024 wef 09/12/2024] (4) The Registrar may, if the Registrar is of the opinion that the financial statements mentioned in subsection (1) do not sufficiently disclose the foreign company’s financial position, require the company — ( a ) to lodge financial statements within such period, in such form and containing such particulars; and ( b ) to annex thereto such documents, as the Registrar may by written notice to the company require.

[Act 17 of 2023 wef 01/07/2023] (19) For the purposes of this section — ( a ) a foreign company is dormant in Singapore during a period in which no accounting transaction arising out of its operations in Singapore occurs; and the company ceases to be dormant on the occurrence of such a transaction; and ( b ) an “accounting transaction” means a transaction for which accounting or other records would be required to be kept so as to enable the documents referred to in subsection (7) to be prepared.

[36/2014] (14) The Registrar must refuse to approve an application to reserve a name under subsection (11) if the Registrar is satisfied that — ( a ) the foreign company is likely to be used for an unlawful purpose or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore; or ( b ) it would be contrary to the national security or interest for the foreign company to be registered. [36/2014] (15) Where an application for a reservation of a name is made under subsection (11), the Registrar must reserve the proposed name for a period starting at the time the Registrar receives the application and ending — ( a ) if the Registrar approves the application — 60 days after the date on which the Registrar notifies the applicant that the application has been approved, or such further period of 60 days as the Registrar may, on application made in good faith, extend; or ( b ) if the Registrar refuses to approve the application — on the date on which the Registrar notifies the applicant of the refusal. [36/2014] (16) A person aggrieved by a decision of the Registrar — ( a ) refusing to approve an application under subsection (11); or ( b ) refusing an application under subsection (15)( a ) to extend the reservation period, may, within 30 days after being informed of the Registrar’s decision, appeal to the Minister whose decision is final. [36/2014] (17) The reservation of a name under this section in respect of a foreign company does not in itself entitle the foreign company to be registered by that name, either originally or upon change of name.
