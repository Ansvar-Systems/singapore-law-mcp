[17/2019] (3) The following are examples of acts or omissions which, in particular circumstances, are ones associated with stalking: ( a ) following the victim or a related person; ( b ) making any communication, or attempting to make any communication, by any means — (i) to the victim or a related person; (ii) relating or purporting to relate to the victim or a related person; or (iii) purporting to originate from the victim or a related person; ( c ) entering or loitering in any place (whether public or private) outside or near the victim’s or a related person’s place of residence or place of business or any other place frequented by the victim or the related person; ( d ) interfering with property in the possession of the victim or a related person (whether or not the accused has an interest in the property); ( e ) giving or sending material to the victim or a related person, or leaving it where it will be found by, given to or brought to the attention of, the victim or a related person; ( f ) keeping the victim or a related person under surveillance.

( b ) Y sends flowers to X daily even though X has asked Y to stop doing so. ( c ) Y repeatedly circulates revealing photographs of a classmate (X) to other classmates. [17/2019] (4) For the purposes of subsection (2)( c ), the accused ought reasonably to know that the accused’s course of conduct is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the victim if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think that the course of conduct is likely to have that effect. [17/2019] (5) In considering whether a course of conduct is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, the court may have regard to the following factors: ( a ) the number of occasions on which the acts or omissions associated with stalking were carried out; ( b ) the frequency and the duration of the acts or omissions associated with stalking that were carried out; ( c ) the manner in which the acts or omissions associated with stalking were carried out; ( d ) the circumstances in which the acts or omissions associated with stalking were carried out; ( e ) the particular combination of acts or omissions associated with stalking comprised in the course of conduct; ( f ) the likely effects of the course of conduct on the victim’s safety, health, reputation, economic position, or the victim’s freedom to do any act which he or she is legally entitled to do or not to do any act which he or she is not legally bound to do; and ( g ) the circumstances of the victim including his or her physical or mental health and personality. (6) Any individual or entity that contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and, subject to section 8, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. [17/2019] (7) In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (6), it is a defence for the accused to prove — ( a ) that the course of conduct was reasonable in all the circumstances; ( b ) that the course of conduct was pursued under any written law or rule of law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by any person under any written law; ( c ) that the course of conduct was lawfully done under a duty or power under any written law for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime; or ( d ) that the course of conduct was done on behalf of the Government and was necessary for the purposes of national security, national defence or the conduct of international relations. [17/2019] (8) If any dispute arises as to whether any act falls within paragraph ( d ) of subsection (7), a certificate issued under the hand of the Minister responsible for national security, or for national defence or for the conduct of international relations (as the case may be), stating that in the Minister’s opinion any act done by a specified individual or specified entity on a specified occasion falls within that paragraph is conclusive evidence that the act falls within that paragraph. [17/2019] (9) A document purporting to be a certificate issued pursuant to subsection (8) and to be issued under the hand of the Minister shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, be treated as being such a certificate. (10) In this section, “course of conduct” means conduct — ( a ) on one occasion, if — (i) the conduct is protracted; or (ii) the accused has a previous conviction under this section in respect of the same victim; or ( b ) on 2 or more occasions in any other case.

[17/2019] (2) A court may, if it is just and equitable in the circumstances to do so, make a protection order against any individual or entity alleged to have contravened section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 in respect of the victim (called in this section the respondent) if it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that — ( a ) the respondent has contravened section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 in respect of the victim; and ( b ) the respondent is likely to continue that contravention or to commit another contravention of section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 in respect of the victim. [17/2019] (2A) For the purposes of subsection (2)( a ), a court is deemed to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the respondent has contravened section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 in respect of the victim if — ( a ) the respondent has been convicted of that offence, or any offence specified in the Schedule, in respect of the victim; or ( b ) the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the respondent has voluntarily caused hurt (within the meaning given by section 321 of the Penal Code 1871) to the victim. [17/2019] (2B) A protection order under subsection (2) may provide for all or any of the following: ( a ) prohibit the respondent from doing any thing in relation to the victim or any related person of the victim, as may be specified in the order; ( b ) if the likely contravention or likely continuing contravention of section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 mentioned in subsection (2)( b ) involves an offending communication, require the respondent to stop publishing (before a specified time) the offending communication or to not publish any communication that is substantially similar to the offending communication; ( c ) refer the respondent, the victim or a related person of the victim (or 2 or more of them) to attend counselling or mediation provided by such body as the court may direct. [17/2019] (2C) To avoid doubt, a protection order may, under subsection (2B)( a ), grant the right of exclusive occupation to the victim of the shared residence or a specified part of the shared residence by excluding the respondent from that shared residence or a specified part of the shared residence, whether or not the shared residence is solely owned or leased by the respondent or jointly owned or leased by the respondent and the victim. [17/2019] (2D) Except so far as the exercise by the respondent of a right to the shared residence is suspended or restricted, or prohibited or restrained, by virtue of an order made under subsection (2C), the order does not affect any title or interest that the respondent or any other person might have in the residence. [17/2019] (2E) In addition, where a court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that — ( a ) the respondent’s contravention involves an offending communication; and ( b ) any other individual or entity (called in this section a third party) is likely to publish, or continue to publish, the offending communication or any communication that is substantially similar to the offending communication, the court may, if it is just and equitable in the circumstances to do so, make a protection order requiring any third party to stop publishing, by a specified time, or to not publish the offending communication or any communication that is substantially similar to the offending communication. [17/2019] (2F) Where a court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that — ( a ) the respondent’s contravention involves an offending communication; and ( b ) the respondent or a third party has published, or is likely to publish or continue to publish, the offending communication by means of an internet intermediary service provided by an internet intermediary, the court may also, if it is just and equitable in the circumstances to do so, make a protection order requiring the internet intermediary to disable access by end‑users of the service in Singapore, within a specified time, to — ( c ) the offending communication; or ( d ) in the case of a prescribed internet intermediary — (i) the offending communication; or (ii) any identical copy of the offending communication. [17/2019] (3) A protection order under subsection (2), (2E) or (2F) may also include any requirement necessary for or incidental to the proper carrying into effect of the order. [17/2019] (4) A protection order may be made subject to such exceptions or conditions as may be specified in the order. (5) An order under this section takes effect in respect of a relevant party — ( a ) when the order is served on the relevant party in such manner as may be prescribed; ( b ) where the court dispenses with the service of the order, when the service of the order on the relevant party is dispensed with by the court; or ( c ) at such later time as the court may specify. [17/2019] (6) Subject to subsection (7), a protection order ceases to have effect after such period as the court may specify in the order. [17/2019] (7) The court may, on the application of the victim or a relevant party, vary, suspend or cancel the protection order or extend the duration of the protection order. [17/2019] (8) [ Deleted by Act 17 of 2019 ] (9) For the purposes of this section and section 13, the victim of any contravention of section 3 includes only the person to whom the respondent intended to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and not any other person harassed, alarmed or distressed by that contravention. (10) In this section and section 13, “third party” excludes any individual or entity that is likely to publish, or continue to publish, a communication mentioned in subsection (2E) merely by the provision of — ( a ) an internet intermediary service; ( b ) a telecommunication service; ( c ) a service of giving the public access to the internet; or ( d ) a computing resource service.

      "title": "Mandatory treatment order where protection order made",
      "content": "13B. —(1) Where a court makes a protection order under section 12(2), the court may, on the application of the victim or on its own initiative, make a mandatory treatment order requiring the respondent to undergo psychiatric treatment for a period not exceeding 36 months. [17/2019] (2) A mandatory treatment order may also require the respondent to reside in a psychiatric institution during the whole or a specified part of the period that the respondent is required to undergo psychiatric treatment. [17/2019] (3) Before making a mandatory treatment order against a respondent, the court must — ( a ) have reasonable grounds to believe that — (i) the respondent is likely to be suffering from a psychiatric condition; and (ii) that psychiatric condition is likely to be a contributing factor for the respondent’s contravention that formed the basis for making the protection order against the respondent; and ( b ) call for a formal assessment report in respect of the respondent by an appointed psychiatrist. [17/2019] (4) In making a determination under subsection (3)( a ), the court — ( a ) may call for a preliminary assessment report by a specified psychiatrist; and ( b ) must consider any matter prescribed by regulations made under section 20. [17/2019] (5) There is no appeal against any decision of the court under this section to call for or not to call for a preliminary assessment report. [17/2019] (6) For the purpose of obtaining a preliminary assessment report from a specified psychiatrist in respect of a respondent, the court may order the respondent to attend before the specified psychiatrist at such times and places as the specified psychiatrist may require. [17/2019] (7) For the purpose of obtaining a formal assessment report from an appointed psychiatrist in respect of a respondent, the court may order the respondent to — ( a ) reside in a psychiatric institution for observation for one or more periods (each not exceeding 3 weeks) as the court thinks fit; or ( b ) attend before the appointed psychiatrist at a psychiatric institution at such times as the appointed psychiatrist may require. [17/2019] (8) A court must not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of a respondent unless the formal assessment report in respect of the respondent certifies that — ( a ) the respondent is suffering from a psychiatric condition that is susceptible to treatment; ( b ) the respondent is suitable for the treatment; and ( c ) the psychiatric condition is a contributing factor for the respondent’s contravention that formed the basis for making the protection order against the respondent. [17/2019] (9) A court must not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of a respondent if the formal assessment report in respect of the respondent certifies that the appointed psychiatrist is not satisfied as to any of the matters mentioned in subsection (8)( a ), ( b ) or ( c ). [17/2019] (10) In assessing whether a respondent is a person suitable for treatment for the respondent’s psychiatric condition, the appointed psychiatrist may take into account the following factors: ( a ) whether the respondent is likely to attend the treatment sessions at such time and place as the appointed psychiatrist may require; ( b ) the physical and mental state of the respondent; ( c ) the respondent’s financial standing and ability to pay all or any part of the costs of the treatment that it is reasonable for the respondent to pay. [17/2019] (11) Where a court calls for a formal assessment report in respect of a respondent, the respondent may submit any report by another psychiatrist, engaged by the respondent, to the appointed psychiatrist not later than — ( a ) the end of a period of 3 weeks after the date the court calls for the formal assessment report; or ( b ) such later time as the court may allow. [17/2019] (12) Before making a formal assessment report, the appointed psychiatrist must take into consideration any report submitted by the respondent under subsection (11). [17/2019] (13) Any report by the appointed psychiatrist is to be taken to be final and conclusive as to the matters mentioned in subsection (8)( a ), ( b ) and ( c ).

[17/2019] (16) A court may impose such conditions as the court thinks fit when making a mandatory treatment order. [17/2019] (17) Before making a mandatory treatment order, the court must explain to the respondent in ordinary language — ( a ) the purpose and effect of the order, and in particular the obligations of the respondent as specified in subsection (21); ( b ) the consequences which may follow if the respondent fails to comply with any of those obligations, or any conditions of the order; and ( c ) that the court has the power, under subsection (18), to vary or revoke the order on the application of the appointed psychiatrist. [17/2019] (18) The court may, on the application of the appointed psychiatrist and whether or not the respondent has failed to comply with subsection (21) — ( a ) vary a mandatory treatment order (including reducing or extending the period that the respondent has to undergo psychiatric treatment) or the conditions of the order in such manner as the court thinks just and expedient in the circumstances; or ( b ) after taking into account the extent to which the respondent has complied with the order, revoke the order. [17/2019] (19) The court may vary or revoke a mandatory treatment order under subsection (18) if such variation or revocation is justified in view of — ( a ) any change of the circumstances after the order was made; or ( b ) the progress the respondent has made in the treatment. [17/2019] (20) Where, under subsection (18)( a ), a court extends the period that the respondent has to undergo psychiatric treatment under a mandatory treatment order, the period of psychiatric treatment must not exceed 36 months from the date the order is first in force. [17/2019] (21) A respondent in respect of whom a mandatory treatment order is in force must — ( a ) attend the treatment sessions on such day and at such time and place as the appointed psychiatrist may require; ( b ) comply with all other conditions in connection with the respondent’s treatment as the appointed psychiatrist may require; and ( c ) comply with all other conditions or requirements of the order. [17/2019] (22) The Minister charged with the responsibility for health may make regulations in relation to the treatment of a person subject to a mandatory treatment order. [17/2019] (23) To avoid doubt, failure to comply with subsection (21) or disobedience with or breach of an order under subsection (6) or (7), if intentional, is a contempt of court.
