[25/2019] (5) For the purposes of this section, a judgment is taken to be final and conclusive even though — ( a ) an appeal may be pending against it; or ( b ) it may still be subject to appeal, in the courts of the country of the original court.

[40/2019] (2) On an application under subsection (1), the court shall, subject to proof of the prescribed matters and to the provisions of this Act, order the judgment to be registered.

[25/2019] (5) If it appears to the registering court that a money judgment awards damages (including exemplary or punitive damages) that are in excess of compensation for the actual loss or harm suffered by the party awarded the damages, the judgment may only be registered for the amount of the compensation. [25/2019] (6) In making its decision under subsection (5), the registering court must take into account whether, and the extent to which, the damages awarded by the original court serve to cover costs and expenses relating to the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained. [25/2019] (7) Subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to the setting aside of registration — ( a ) a registered judgment shall, for the purposes of enforcement, be of the same force and effect; [Act 25 of 2021 wef 01/04/2022] ( b ) proceedings may be taken on a registered judgment; ( c ) the sum for which a judgment is registered shall carry interest; and ( d ) the registering court shall have the same control over the enforcement of a registered judgment, as if the judgment had been a judgment originally given in the registering court and entered on the date of registration.

[16/2016] [Act 25 of 2021 wef 01/04/2022] (9) If at the date of the application for registration the judgment of the original court has been partly satisfied, the judgment shall not be registered in respect of the whole sum payable under the judgment of the original court, but only in respect of the balance remaining payable at the date. (10) If, on an application for the registration of a judgment, it appears to the registering court that the judgment is in respect of different matters and that some, but not all, of the provisions of the judgment are such that if those provisions had been contained in separate judgments those judgments could properly have been registered, the judgment may be registered in respect of the provisions aforesaid but not in respect of any other provisions contained therein. (11) In addition to any sum of money payable under the judgment of the original court (including any interest which by the law of the country of the original court becomes due under the judgment up to the time of registration), or the amount of the monetary equivalent of the relief mentioned in subsection (4)( b ) (as the case may be), the judgment must be registered for the reasonable costs of and incidental to registration, including the costs of obtaining a certified copy of the judgment from the original court.

[25/2019] (4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3), the courts of the country of the original court shall not be deemed to have had jurisdiction — ( a ) if the subject matter of the proceedings was immovable property outside the country of the original court; ( b ) except in the cases mentioned in subsection (3)( a )(i), (ii) and (iii) and ( c ), if the bringing of the proceedings in the original court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of the country of that court; or ( c ) if the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the proceedings in the original court, was a person who under the rules of public international law was entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the country of the original court and did not submit to the jurisdiction of that court. (5) In this section, “notice of registration” means a notice of the registration of a judgment mentioned in section 8(1)( c ) that is required to be served on a judgment debtor by the Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules, as the case may be.
