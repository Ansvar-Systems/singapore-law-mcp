(4) Where the application is for the relief mentioned in subsection (1)( b ), the Judge is to grant an interim injunction restraining the enterprise from transferring or removing its machinery or equipment and to issue a notice calling upon the enterprise to show cause on a date to be specified in the notice as to why the management of the enterprise should not be transferred to the Board. (5) Before making any order or injunction under subsection (3) or (4), the Judge may examine the officer making the application.

(7) If no cause is shown on or before the date specified in the notice under subsections (4) and (6), the Judge is to immediately make the interim order final and direct the sale of the attached property or transfer the management of the enterprise to the Board or confirm the injunction. (8) If cause is shown, the Judge is to proceed to investigate the claim of the Board and the provisions of the Rules of Court apply as far as practicable to the proceedings. (9) On an investigation made under subsection (8), the Judge is to make an order — ( a ) confirming the order of attachment and directing the sale of the attached property; ( b ) varying the order of attachment so as to release a portion of the property from attachment and directing the sale of the remainder of the attached property; ( c ) releasing the property from attachment, if the Judge is satisfied that it is not necessary in the interests of the Board; ( d ) confirming or dissolving the injunction; or ( e ) transferring the management of the enterprise to the Board or rejecting the claim made in this behalf.
