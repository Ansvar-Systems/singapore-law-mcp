(2) Where any chattel is requisitioned under this section, a competent authority may use or deal with, or authorise the use or dealing with, the chattel for such purposes and in such manner as the competent authority thinks fit and may — ( a ) hold, or sell or otherwise dispose of, the chattel as if the competent authority were the owner thereof and as if the chattel were free from any mortgage, pledge, lien or other similar obligation; and ( b ) in a case where the chattel requisitioned is a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, acquire it by serving on the owner thereof a notice stating that the competent authority has acquired it pursuant to this section. (3) When a notice of acquisition has been served under subsection (2), then, at the beginning of the day on which the notice is served — ( a ) the vehicle, vessel or aircraft vests in the Government free from any mortgage, pledge, lien or other similar obligation; and ( b ) the period of the requisition thereof ends. (4) Without affecting the powers conferred by subsections (1) and (2), the competent authority may by order require the owners of, and the persons having power to dispose of, chattels of any description specified in the order, being chattels situate outside Singapore, to comply with such directions as may be given by or on behalf of the competent authority for the purpose of securing that the ownership of the chattels or the right to dispose of the chattels is transferred to the competent authority. (5) A competent authority may, if it appears to the competent authority to be necessary for the effectual exercise of the competent authority’s powers under subsection (1) to do so, by order — ( a ) direct that any person who, at the time when the order takes effect, has in the person’s possession or under the person’s control, at any premises, any such articles as may be described in the order, must not remove the articles, or cause or permit them to be removed, from the premises until the removal of the articles from the premises is permitted by that competent authority or person as may be specified in the order; ( b ) require the owner or occupier of any premises to send to the competent authority or person as may be specified in the order a written declaration stating or estimating whether or not, on such date as may be specified in the order, any such articles were or will be on the premises, and if so, the number or quantity of those articles which was or will be on the premises on that date, according as the order may direct. (6) In any case in which the chattel requisitioned is a chattel other than a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, the chattel, as soon as possession thereof is taken pursuant to this section, vests in the Government free from any mortgage, pledge, lien or other similar obligation. (7) Where a competent authority has issued a notice of requisition in respect of any chattel, the chattel must be furnished by the owner and the person having the possession, custody or control thereof to the competent authority or to such persons as the competent authority must appoint for the purpose forthwith or (if such is the case) within such period as may be prescribed or mentioned in the requisition. (8) On any refusal or neglect to furnish such chattel in the manner aforesaid, or if the competent authority has reasonable ground for believing that it is not practicable without undue delay to give any direction for the chattel requisitioned to be furnished or delivered to the competent authority, then the competent authority or any authorised officer acting on behalf of the competent authority may take possession (and if need be may enter any premises by force for the purpose) of the chattel requisitioned and may use the chattel in a similar manner as if it had been furnished pursuant to the requisition. (9) Payment for the chattel taken possession of under subsection (8) must nevertheless be made in a similar manner as if the chattel had been duly furnished according to the requisition, provided that the chattel specified in the requisition is not deemed to have been furnished except insofar as possession is taken by or by the direction of the competent authority. [26/89] (10) Where the Accountant-General is satisfied that any vehicle in respect of which a licence to keep has been granted has, in exercise of the powers conferred by this section, been acquired before the expiry of the period of the validity of the licence, the Accountant‑General may authorise the refund to the person who at the date of such acquisition was the owner of the vehicle of a proportionate part of the fee paid for the licence in respect of that part of the period of its validity which remains unexpired at that date, if a claim for the refund is made to the Accountant‑General in writing by that person not later than 3 months after the date when the vehicle was acquired as aforesaid. (11) A competent authority may, to such extent and subject to such restrictions as the competent authority thinks proper, delegate all or any of the competent authority’s functions under subsections (1) and (2) to any persons or class of persons specified by the competent authority. (12) The Commissioner of Police must, on a request to that effect made by or on behalf of the authorised officer to whom an order is issued to requisition chattels, give instructions for securing that, so far as practicable, police officers will be available (if required) for accompanying authorised officers requisitioning chattels pursuant to the order. (13) The authorised officer to whom the requisitioning order is issued, or any member of the armed forces or the civil defence force authorised by the authorised officer in writing, may without warrant stop and search any vehicle, vessel or aircraft with a view to ascertaining whether the vehicle, vessel or aircraft is to be requisitioned. (14) The powers conferred by this section for the purpose of conducting exercises for the purposes mentioned in subsection (1) are exercisable only in relation to vehicles, vessels or aircraft. (15) In this section, “chattel” includes any substance, machine, equipment, vehicle, vessel or aircraft but does not include currency, gold, securities or negotiable instruments."

(2) Any compensation under subsection (1)( a ) is considered as accruing due from day to day during the period for which the possession of the land is taken or the land is used or occupied in the exercise of the powers under this Act, and is apportionable in respect of time accordingly, and must be paid to the person who for the time being would be entitled to occupy the land but for the fact that possession thereof is retained or the land is used or occupied in the exercise of such powers; but this subsection does not operate so as to require the making of payments at intervals of less than 3 months.

      "content": "20. —(1) Compensation under this Act in respect of the doing of any work on any land is payable only if the annual value of the land is diminished by reason of the doing of the work. (2) The compensation payable under this Act in respect of the doing of any work on any land is, in the first instance, a sum calculated by reference to the diminution of the annual value of the land ascribable to the doing of the work, and must be paid in instalments, quarterly in arrear, to the person who for the time being is entitled to occupy the land. (3) Any compensation under subsection (2) is considered as accruing due from day to day, and is apportionable in respect of time accordingly. (4) If, at any time after compensation under subsection (2) has become payable by reason of the doing of any work on any land, a person acting on behalf of the competent authority — ( a ) causes the land to be restored, so far as practicable, to the condition in which it would be but for the doing of the work; or ( b ) serves on the person for the time being entitled to occupy the land a written notice of intention to discharge the liability for the compensation by making, not earlier than a date specified in the notice, payment of a lump sum in accordance with this section, the period in respect of which compensation is payable under subsection (2) by reason of the doing of the work ends with the date immediately preceding the date on which the restoration is completed or (as the case may be) the date specified in the notice. (5) Where, by virtue of the operation of subsection (4) in relation to any work done on any land, the period in respect of which compensation under subsection (1) is payable by reason of the doing of the work comes to an end, then if, at the end of that period, the value of any estate or interest which a person then has in the land is less than it would be but for the doing of the work, there must be paid to the person, by way of compensation under this Act, a sum equal to the amount of the said depreciation in the value of the estate or interest; and that compensation is taken to accrue due at the end of the said period. (6) As soon as possible after effecting any restoration or serving any notice pursuant to subsection (4), the person by whom the restoration was effected or the notice was served must cause the fact of the restoration or the contents of the notice (as the case may be) to be published in such manner as the person thinks best adapted for informing persons affected. (7) In determining for the purposes of this section whether the annual value of any land is diminished by reason of the doing of any work on the land, and in assessing any compensation under this section in respect of the doing of any work on any land, it is assumed that the land cannot be restored to the condition in which it would be but for the doing of the work. (8) For the purposes of this section, no account is to be taken of any diminution or depreciation in value ascribable only to loss of pleasure or amenity. (9) In this section — “annual value”, in relation to any land, means the rent at which the land might reasonably be expected to let from year to year, if the landlord undertook to bear the costs of the repairs and insurance and the other expenses (if any) necessary to maintain the land in a state to command that rent; and “diminution of the annual value”, in relation to the doing of any work on any land, means the amount by which the annual value of the land is less than it would be if the work had not been done."

(3) No compensation is by virtue of this section payable in respect of any loss of, or damage to, any vehicle, vessel or aircraft arising in consequence of any disaster or war operations, unless it is shown that, at the time when the loss or damage occurred, the risk of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft being lost or damaged in consequence of the disaster or war operations was materially increased by reason of the requisition thereof in the exercise of any power under this Act.

(8) The compensation payable under this Act in respect of the acquisition of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft is a sum equal to the value of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft immediately before the acquisition, no account being taken of any appreciation due to any disaster or war, whether actual or imminent, and must, subject to the provisions of this Act, be paid to the person who is then the owner of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft. (9) For the purpose of assessing any compensation under subsection (8) in respect of the acquisition of any vehicle, vessel or aircraft, no account is to be taken of any compensation under subsection (1)( a ) or ( b ) which may have become payable in respect of the requisition of that vehicle, vessel or aircraft. (10) Where, at any time during the period for which a vehicle, vessel or aircraft is requisitioned by or on behalf of the competent authority in the exercise of any power under this Act, a written notice stating that the vehicle, vessel or aircraft is to be treated as acquired by or on behalf of the competent authority is served on the owner thereof by the competent authority, then, for the purposes of this section, the vehicle, vessel or aircraft is deemed to have been acquired by or on behalf of the competent authority in the exercise of any power under this Act immediately before the day on which the written notice was served and the period of requisition is deemed to have ended at the time when the acquisition of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft that is deemed by virtue of this subsection to have been effected."
