(6) For the purpose of determining whether a provisional order should be confirmed under subsection (5), the court is to proceed as if an application for the variation or revocation (as the case may be) of the maintenance order in question had been made to it. (7) Where a maintenance order to which this section applies has been varied by an order (including a provisional order which has been confirmed) made by a court in Singapore or by a competent court in a reciprocating country, the maintenance order has, as from the date on which under the provisions of the order the variation is to take effect, effect as varied by that order and, where that order was a provisional order, as if that order had been made in the form in which it was confirmed and as if it had never been a provisional order.

[2/2012] (3) In any proceedings for the confirmation under this section of a provisional order, the statement received from the court which made the order of the grounds on which the making of the order might have been opposed by the payer under the order is conclusive evidence that the payer might have opposed the making of the order on any of those grounds in the proceedings in which the order was made. [2/2012] (4) For the purpose of determining whether a provisional order should be confirmed under this section, the court is to proceed as if an application for a maintenance order against the payer under the provisional order had been made to it.

(4) On an application for the revocation of a registered order, the registering court, unless both the payer and the payee under the registered order are for the time being residing in Singapore, is to apply the law applied by the reciprocating country in which the registered order was made; but where by virtue of this subsection the registering court is required to apply that law, that court may make a provisional order if it has reason to believe that the ground on which the application is made is a ground on which the order could be revoked according to the law applied by the reciprocating country, even though it has not been established that it is such a ground. (5) Where the registering court makes a provisional order varying or revoking a registered order, the prescribed officer of the court must send in the prescribed manner to the court in the reciprocating country which made the registered order a certified copy of the provisional order together with a document, authenticated in the prescribed manner, setting out or summarising the evidence given in the proceedings. (6) Where a certified copy of a provisional order made by a court in a reciprocating country, being an order varying a registered order, together with a document, duly authenticated, setting out or summarising the evidence given in the proceedings in which the provisional order was made, is received by the registering court, that court may confirm the order either without alteration or with such alterations as it thinks reasonable or refuse to confirm the order. (7) For the purpose of determining whether a provisional order should be confirmed under subsection (6), the court is to proceed as if an application for the variation of the registered order had been made to it. (8) Where a registered order has been varied by an order (including a provisional order which has been confirmed) made by a court in Singapore or by a competent court in a reciprocating country, the registered order has, as from the date on which under the provisions of the order the variation is to take effect, effect as varied by that order and, where that order was a provisional order, as if that order had been made in the form in which it was confirmed and as if it had never been a provisional order. [2/2012] (9) Where a registered order has been revoked by an order made by a court in Singapore or by a competent court in a reciprocating country, including a provisional order made by the firstmentioned court which has been confirmed by a competent court in a reciprocating country, the registered order is deemed, as from the date on which under the provisions of the order the revocation is to take effect, to have ceased to have effect except as respects any arrears due under the registered order at that date.

(3) Where the sum specified in any statement (being a statement of the amount of any arrears due under a maintenance order made by a court in a reciprocating country) is expressed in a currency other than the currency of Singapore, that sum is deemed to be such sum in the currency of Singapore as, on the basis of the rate of exchange prevailing at the relevant date, is equivalent to the sum so specified. (4) For the purposes of this section, a written certificate purporting to be signed by an officer of any bank in Singapore certifying that a specified rate of exchange prevailed between currencies at a specified date and that at such rate a specified sum in the currency of Singapore is equivalent to a specified sum in another specified currency is evidence of the rate of exchange so prevailing on that date and of the equivalent sums in terms of the respective currencies. (5) In this section, “the relevant date” means — ( a ) in relation to a registered order or to a statement of arrears due under a maintenance order made by a court in a reciprocating country — the date on which the order first becomes a registered order or (if earlier) the date on which it is confirmed by a court in Singapore; and ( b ) in relation to a registered order which has been varied — the date on which the last order varying that order is registered in a court in Singapore or (if earlier) the date on which the last order varying that order is confirmed by such a court."
