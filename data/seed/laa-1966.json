[12/2015] (2) Upon the direction of the President under subsection (1) to procure the temporary occupation and use of any land that is not State land, the Collector or any person authorised by the Collector has the right to enter upon and take temporary possession of that land in accordance with the terms of that direction. [12/2015] (3) However, the Collector or a person authorised by the Collector is not to exercise any right conferred by subsection (2) in respect of any land unless the Collector has given at least one month’s notice of the Collector’s intention to exercise that right to the persons interested in the land, and to every occupier of that land. [12/2015] (4) A notice referred to in subsection (3) must — ( a ) state the estimated period (if any) during which the Collector intends to temporarily occupy or take possession of the land; ( b ) give a brief description of the works (if any) which are to be carried out in or on that land; ( c ) describe the area or extent of the land needed for the carrying out of the works mentioned in paragraph ( b ); and ( d ) state that any person interested in the land may serve on the Collector a claim of compensation for the items of loss, damage or cost set out in the first column of the Schedule to the extent of the loss, damage or cost suffered or incurred by the person interested.
