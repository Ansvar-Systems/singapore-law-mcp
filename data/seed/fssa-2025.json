(2) The Agency must not make any directive under subsection (1) with respect to any relevant live food producing animal, unless it is impracticable, in the circumstances of the particular case, for any order under section 7(1) of the Animals and Birds Act 1965 to be made or amended to effectively alleviate or minimise the risk concerned. (3) Once a directive is made under subsection (1), the Agency must cause to be published a public notice of the directive — ( a ) in the Gazette ; or ( b ) in any manner that will secure adequate publicity for the directive, specifying in the public notice the date the ban takes effect, except that where for reasons of national security it is impracticable to publish the directive according to paragraph ( a ) or ( b ), the Agency must notify any person or persons that it thinks appropriate or necessary in the circumstances. (4) Every directive made under subsection (1) comes into force immediately upon its being published according to subsection (3)( a ) or ( b ) or, where notified by service on any person under subsection (3), immediately upon giving the notice to that person and in respect of that person only. (5) Any directive made under subsection (1) may be in force for a period not exceeding 90 days unless earlier revoked under subsection (6), and may be renewed by the Agency only once for a further period not exceeding 30 days. (6) The Agency may, at any time when any directive made under subsection (1) is in force, revoke the directive by publishing a notice of that revocation — ( a ) in the Gazette ; or ( b ) in any manner that will secure adequate publicity for the revoking of the directive. (7) A directive made under subsection (1) prevails so far as the directive is in force even if inconsistent with any provision of — ( a ) this Act; ( b ) the Animals and Birds Act 1965; ( c ) the Control of Plants Act 1993; or ( d ) the Wildlife Act 1965. (8) Without limiting subsection (7), where a directive made under subsection (1) is made and in force — ( a ) every of the following licences, permits or approvals cease to have effect to the extent that the licence, permit or approval is inconsistent with that directive: (i) a licence granted under section 8 of the Animals and Birds Act 1965 to import or tranship any animal or bird; (ii) a permit issued under the Control of Plants Act 1993 to import any live insect‑like species or any mollusc that is not a fish; (iii) an approval granted under section 9 of the Wildlife Act 1965 to import any living wildlife; and ( b ) an application for any of those licences, permits or approvals mentioned in paragraph ( a ) must be refused where the licence, permit or approval, if granted or issued, will be inconsistent with that directive. (9) In subsection (2), “relevant live food producing animal” means a live food producing animal that is neither — ( a ) an insect‑like species; nor ( b ) a mollusc that is not a fish."

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), an inspection advice issued under this section may indicate that a controlled item identified as failing — ( a ) must be destroyed in accordance with the requirements under section 74(3) or (4); ( b ) must either be destroyed or re‑exported from Singapore in accordance with the requirements under that section; or ( c ) must, if not treated by the owner in accordance with the requirements under section 74(2) — (i) be destroyed; or (ii) be destroyed or re-exported from Singapore, in accordance with the requirements of section 74. (3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), the owner of a controlled item identified in an inspection advice as failing may, in the circumstances specified in the inspection scheme regulations, apply, in writing, to an authorised officer or a food inspector for the issue of a further inspection advice in respect of a part of that controlled item. (4) Neither — ( a ) the fact that a controlled item identified as failing under an inspection advice may be the subject of an application under subsection (3) for a further inspection advice; nor ( b ) the making of an application under subsection (3) for a further inspection advice in respect of the controlled item, causes the controlled item to cease to be failing on the basis of the original inspection advice but, if the original inspection advice indicates that the controlled item must be treated, destroyed or re‑exported, the controlled item is not required to be so treated, destroyed or re‑exported unless — ( c ) the circumstances permitting the application for the further inspection advice cease to exist; or ( d ) an application is made under subsection (3) and rejected. (5) If the owner of a controlled item identified in an inspection advice as failing, makes an application under subsection (3) for the issue of a further inspection advice in respect of a part of the controlled item, the owner must, if the controlled item to which the application relates is under customs control, inform the person having possession of the controlled item that the owner had made that application. (6) If an application is made under subsection (3), an authorised officer or a food inspector must — ( a ) if he or she is not satisfied that the application is made in accordance with the requirements of the inspection scheme regulations, reject the application and give notice to the applicant of that rejection and of the reasons for the rejection; and ( b ) in any other case, consider the application and issue to the applicant a further inspection advice in respect of the controlled item the subject of the application. (7) If a further inspection advice is issued in respect of the controlled item the subject of an application, this Act has effect as if — ( a ) that further inspection advice were substituted for the initial inspection advice issued in respect of that controlled item under subsection (1); and ( b ) subsection (3) were not included."

      "content": "74. —(1) This section applies to a controlled item that — ( a ) has been identified in an inspection advice as failing; and ( b ) is required, under that advice, to be treated, destroyed or re‑exported from Singapore. (2) If an inspection advice, given in respect of a controlled item to which this section applies, permits the treatment of the controlled item so as to bring it into compliance with this Act or to enable its use for a purpose other than human consumption, an authorised officer or a food inspector may, by written notice given to the owner of the controlled item — ( a ) require the owner to treat the controlled item in a specified manner or in a manner to be agreed between the owner and the authorised officer or food inspector (as the case may be) so as to enable it to be brought into compliance with this Act or to be so used for a purpose other than human consumption; or ( b ) if the owner is unable or unwilling to so treat the controlled item, require either — (i) the destruction of the controlled item in a manner specified in the notice or in a manner to be agreed between the owner and the authorised officer or food inspector; or (ii) the re‑export of the controlled item. (3) If an inspection advice requires the destruction of a controlled item to which this section applies, an authorised officer or a food inspector may, by written notice given to the owner of the controlled item, require its destruction in a manner specified in the notice or in a manner to be agreed between the owner and the authorised officer or food inspector. (4) If an inspection advice requires the destruction or re‑export of a controlled item to which this section applies, an authorised officer or a food inspector may, by written notice given to the owner of the controlled item, require either — ( a ) its destruction in a manner specified in the notice or in a manner to be agreed between the owner and the authorised officer or food inspector; or ( b ) its re‑export. (5) A permission to treat or a requirement to destroy or re‑export a controlled item in a written notice under subsection (2), (3) or (4) must specify a period (having regard to the reasons why the controlled item has been identified as failing and to any difficulties associated with arranging for its treatment, destruction or re‑export) within which that treatment, destruction or re-export is to be completed. (6) If the owner of a controlled item that is required in a written notice under subsection (2), (3) or (4) to be treated, destroyed or re‑exported arranges for a treatment, destruction or re‑export in accordance with the written notice, that treatment, destruction or re‑export may be supervised by an authorised officer or a food inspector. (7) If the owner of a controlled item that is required in a written notice under subsection (2), (3) or (4) to be destroyed or re‑exported refuses or fails to arrange for the destruction or re‑export of the controlled item in accordance with the written notice, the Agency may — ( a ) carry out or cause to be carried out the destruction or re‑export required in that written notice; and ( b ) recover all expenses reasonably incurred by the Agency in the exercise of the powers under this subsection from the person in default. (8) Without limiting the right of the Agency to exercise any power under subsection (7), the owner of a controlled item that is required in a written notice under subsection (2), (3) or (4) to be destroyed or re‑exported commits an offence if the owner intentionally refuses or fails to comply with the requirement to destroy or re‑export that controlled item. (9) A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (8) shall be liable on conviction — ( a ) where the person is an individual — (i) to a fine not exceeding $15,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both; or (ii) where the individual is a repeat offender — to a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both; or ( b ) where the person is not an individual — (i) to a fine not exceeding $30,000; or (ii) where the person is a repeat offender — to a fine not exceeding $60,000. (10) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse. (11) In this section — “owner”, in relation to a controlled item that is permitted to be treated or required to be destroyed or re‑exported, means a person having a beneficial interest in the controlled item other than a person who has such an interest only because he or she has been given a mortgage or charge, or has a lien, over the goods; “repeat offender”, in relation to an offence under this section, means a person who — ( a ) is convicted, or found guilty, of such an offence (called the current offence); and ( b ) has been convicted or found guilty, on at least one other earlier occasion within the period of 5 years immediately before the date on which the person is convicted or found guilty of the current offence, of an offence under this section."

(2) The written notice must state all of the following: ( a ) the proposed action, including (where applicable) the type of action in section 82, 83, 84, 95, 96, 112, 195, 196 or 213 that the Agency proposes to take; ( b ) the grounds for the proposed action; ( c ) the facts and circumstances forming the basis for the grounds; ( d ) if the proposed action is suspension of the FSSA authorisation, the proposed suspension period; ( e ) if the proposed action is modifying any condition of the FSSA authorisation, the proposed modification; ( f ) that representations may be made about the notice; ( g ) how and where representations may be made, and a period within which the representations must be made. (3) The stated period in subsection (2)( g ) must be, or must end, at least 14 days after the notice is given. (4) If, after considering all representations made within the stated period the Agency still considers any proposed action should be taken, the Agency may — ( a ) if the proposed course of action is modifying under section 82, 95 or 195 any condition of the FSSA authorisation — modify the condition; or ( b ) if the proposed course of action is any regulatory action under section 83, 84, 96, 112, 196 or 213 — take any regulatory action mentioned in the appropriate section that the Agency considers appropriate. (5) Where the Agency has made any decision under subsection (4) against any holder of an FSSA authorisation, the Agency must serve on the holder concerned a notice of the Agency’s decision. (6) Subject to Part 12, a decision under subsection (4) that is specified in the notice given under subsection (5) takes effect starting the date on which that notice is given, or on another later date if specified in that notice. (7) Any suspension, cancellation or revocation of an FSSA authorisation with respect to the holder of the FSSA authorisation does not affect — ( a ) the enforcement by any person of any right or claim against the holder; or ( b ) the enforcement by the holder of any right or claim against any person. (8) However, if the Agency — ( a ) considers it necessary in the public interest of Singapore to suspend an FSSA authorisation urgently; or ( b ) has reasonable grounds to believe there is a serious and imminent risk to public health and that it is appropriate or requisite, to avoid any actual or imminent occurrence that endangers or threatens to endanger the safety of the public, to suspend the FSSA authorisation urgently, the Agency may immediately suspend, for a period not exceeding 30 days, the FSSA authorisation by written notice given to the holder thereof. (9) Subsections (1) to (4) do not apply where the holder of the authorisation in question — ( a ) has died or is adjudged a bankrupt; ( b ) has been dissolved or wound up; or ( c ) has otherwise ceased to exist.

(3) The period the Agency may specify in a written order under subsection (2) is a period not exceeding 3 years starting immediately after the date of revocation of an invalidated authorisation. (4) Any FSSA authorisation obtained by a person while disqualified by a written order of the Agency under this section from obtaining such an authorisation is of no effect.

Financial penalties, etc. 299. —(1) Where any financial penalty is imposed on a holder of an FSSA authorisation under the provisions of this Act, for contravening or not complying with — ( a ) any condition attached to the FSSA authorisation; ( b ) any provision of this Act applicable to the holder of the FSSA authorisation so far as that relates to the activity covered by the authorisation; or ( c ) any provision of a code of practice applicable to the holder of the FSSA authorisation so far as that relates to the activity covered by the FSSA authorisation, any performance bond, guarantee or other form of security furnished by the holder must not be forfeited by the Agency for that contravention or non‑compliance except to the extent to pay the financial penalty. (2) All financial penalties imposed under this Act because of regulatory action, and any moneys under a performance bond, deposit or other form of security forfeited under regulatory action for the purpose of meeting any financial penalty so imposed must be collected by the Agency and paid into the Consolidated Fund. (3) The Agency may recover as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction any of the following amounts that has become due and payable but has not been paid: ( a ) any fee imposed under any provision of this Act in respect of an FSSA authorisation; ( b ) any financial penalty imposed under any provision of this Act in respect of a holder or former holder of an FSSA authorisation, and the liability of the holder or former holder concerned to pay is not affected by the holder’s or former holder’s FSSA authorisation ceasing (for any reason) to be in force.
