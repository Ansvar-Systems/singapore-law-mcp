(2) A direction given under subsection (1) — ( a ) may require the licensee concerned (according to the circumstances of the case) to do, or to refrain from doing, for a specified period, the things specified in the direction or the things that are of a description specified in the direction; ( b ) takes effect at such time, being the earliest practicable time, as is determined by or under that direction; and ( c ) may be revoked at any time by the LTA. (3) Without limiting subsection (2), a direction under subsection (1) so as to alleviate or minimise any risk of obstructing any measures taken to reduce the impact of any serious public passenger transport incident in Singapore or a part of Singapore, may require the licensee concerned to stop providing point‑to‑point passenger transport services specified in the direction to hirers in any part of Singapore, for a period not exceeding 24 hours, or any further periods not exceeding 24 hours each. (4) A direction under this section continues in force until the earlier of the following occurs: ( a ) the expiry date (if any) stated in the direction is reached; ( b ) the LTA revokes the direction. (5) Before exercising any power under subsection (1), the LTA must, unless the LTA in respect of any particular direction considers that it is not practicable or desirable, give written notice to the licensee concerned — ( a ) stating that the LTA intends to give a direction to the licensee under this section and the nature of the direction; and ( b ) specifying the time (being not less than 14 days after the date of service of the notice on the licensee) within which written representations may be made to the LTA with respect to the proposed direction. (6) The LTA may, after considering any written representation under subsection (5)( b ), decide to give or not to give, or to modify, the direction as the LTA considers appropriate. (7) The LTA must serve on the licensee concerned a notice of its decision under subsection (6). (8) Every licensee must comply with every direction given under this section to the licensee as soon as it takes effect. (9) However, nothing in this section authorises the LTA to give any direction with regard to fares which are regulated by the PTC under the Public Transport Council Act 1987. (10) In this section, “serious public passenger transport incident” includes any of the following: ( a ) a stoppage or disruption of more than one regular route service (within the meaning given by the Bus Services Industry Act 2015) in Singapore or any part of Singapore; ( b ) a large‑scale disruption of services on one or more rapid transit systems within the meaning of the Rapid Transit Systems Act 1995.

(4) Once such an emergency directive is made and given under this section, the LTA must also publish the making of the directive in a manner that the LTA thinks will secure adequate publicity for the fact of making and giving of the emergency directive.

(2) However, the LTA may, in lieu of revoking a licensee’s licence under subsection (1), do any one or more of the following: ( a ) censure the licensee in writing; ( b ) modify any condition of the licence (sections 16(2) and 22(2) being disapplied); ( c ) direct the furnishing of any performance bond, guarantee or other form of security, or an additional performance bond, guarantee or other form of security, for either or both the following: (i) to secure compliance by the licensee with any condition attached to the licence or any code of practice applicable to the licensee; (ii) for the purpose of meeting any financial penalty arising out of any regulatory action started or likely to start against the licensee; ( d ) direct the licensee to do, or to refrain from doing, such things as are specified in a direction to rectify any contravention or non‑compliance mentioned in subsection (1)( a ); ( e ) suspend the licence without any compensation for not more than 3 months; ( f ) direct the licensee to pay, within a period specified in a direction, a financial penalty of such amount as the LTA thinks fit, but not exceeding the maximum specified in subsection (6).
