(9B) Despite subsection (9), the Registration Officer may, without holding any public inquiry — ( a ) allow any claim in respect of which no objection is made if the Registration Officer is satisfied that the claim should be allowed, and insert the claimant’s name in the register and, where applicable, register the claimant as an overseas elector; or ( b ) reject any claim if the Registration Officer is satisfied that — (i) the claimant was not a citizen of Singapore on the prescribed date mentioned in section 5(4); (ii) the claimant was below 21 years of age on the prescribed date mentioned in section 5(4); [Act 8 of 2023 wef 01/06/2023] (iii) where the claimant claims to be entitled to have the claimant’s name entered in the register for an electoral division on the ground of a change in the claimant’s residential address, the new address specified in the claimant’s claim is not the address of any premises in that electoral division; or [Act 8 of 2023 wef 01/06/2023] (iv) the claim is frivolous or vexatious.

[41/2018] (10) Subject to subsection (9C), where an objection is made to the inclusion or insertion of any name in the register, the Registration Officer must call upon the objector, or some person authorised in writing in that behalf by the objector, to give prima facie proof of the ground of the objection unless the Registration Officer is satisfied that the objection is frivolous or vexatious, in which case the Registration Officer may overrule the objection without further inquiry into the objection. [41/2018] [Act 8 of 2023 wef 01/06/2023] (11) If such prima facie proof is given, the Registration Officer must require proof of the entitlement of the person in regard to whom objection has been made, and — ( a ) if the person’s entitlement is not proved to the Registration Officer’s satisfaction, the Registration Officer must expunge that person’s name from or (as the case may be) refuse to insert that person’s name in the register; or ( b ) if the person’s entitlement is so proved, the Registration Officer must retain that person’s name or (as the case may be) insert that person’s name in the register and, where applicable, register that person as an overseas elector. (12) If, on the date fixed for inquiry into any objection, the objector or a person authorised in writing in that behalf by the objector fails to appear, or appears but fails to give such prima facie proof, then — ( a ) if the objection is to the inclusion in the register of the name of a person appearing in the register, the Registration Officer must retain the person’s name in the register without calling upon the person to prove his or her entitlement; or ( b ) if the objection is to the insertion in the register of the name of any claimant, the Registration Officer must require proof of the entitlement of the claimant; and — (i) if the claimant’s entitlement is not proved to the Registration Officer’s satisfaction, the Registration Officer must refuse to insert the claimant’s name in the register; or (ii) if the claimant’s entitlement is so proved, the Registration Officer must insert the claimant’s name in the register and, where applicable, register the person as an overseas elector. (13) If an objection is made and is overruled by the Registration Officer and, in the Registration Officer’s opinion, the objection was made without reasonable cause, the Registration Officer may, if he or she thinks fit, order in writing the objector to pay to the person in regard to whom objection has been made such sum not exceeding $50 as the Registration Officer considers reasonable compensation for any loss of time incurred by the person in consequence of the objection. (14) If, upon an objection being overruled, the objector appeals under section 12 to the Revising Officer and the appeal is dismissed, and in the opinion of the Revising Officer the appeal was made without reasonable cause, the Revising Officer may, if he or she thinks fit, order in writing the objector to pay to the person in regard to whom objection has been made such sum not exceeding $50 as the Revising Officer considers reasonable compensation for any loss of time incurred by the person in consequence of the appeal. (14A) If any appeal is allowed by the Revising Officer, he or she has power to revise or cancel any order made by the Registration Officer for the payment of compensation by the objector. (15) Any sum awarded as compensation under this section is recoverable as though the order of the Registration Officer or Revising Officer were an order of a District Court for the recovery of money by that Officer."

[Act 8 of 2023 wef 01/06/2023] (4C) To avoid doubt, the registration of any person under this section as an overseas elector for an electoral division does not end or become cancelled just because a certified register of electors for the electoral division is superseded by the coming into operation of — ( a ) the next certified register relating to the same or any area within that electoral division following a notification under section 8 specifying the boundaries of electoral divisions; or ( b ) the composite register deemed the next certified register relating to the same or any area within that electoral division, following the creation of any new electoral division or altering of any electoral division in the manner mentioned in section 20A(1)( a ) or ( b ).

[41/2018] (8) When, after the counting of votes (including any recount conducted under section 49B) is completed, an equality of votes is found to exist between any candidates or groups of candidates, and the addition of a vote would entitle any of the candidates or groups of candidates to be declared elected, the determination of the candidate or group of candidates to whom the one additional vote is deemed to have been given must be made by lot in the presence of the Returning Officer in such manner as the Returning Officer may determine. [41/2018] (9) After the Returning Officer has made any declaration under subsection (7) or (7E), the Returning Officer must ensure that the following procedures are complied with at every counting place and principal counting place: ( a ) all ballot papers and all other documents relating to the election at every counting place and principal counting place must be sealed up in separate packets and placed in any ballot box or boxes; ( b ) the ballot box or boxes must then be sealed with the seal of the Returning Officer and the seals of such of the candidates or their counting agents as attend and desire to affix their seals; ( c ) the sealed ballot box or boxes must be despatched and delivered in safe custody to the Returning Officer; ( d ) subject to subsection (10), the ballot papers and other documents in the sealed ballot box or boxes must be retained in safe custody for a period of 6 months; ( e ) the ballot papers and other documents must be destroyed at the end of the period of 6 months unless otherwise directed by order of the President. (10) A Judge sitting in the General Division of the High Court may make an order that any ballot paper or other document relating to an election which has been sealed as required by this Act be inspected, copied or produced at such time and place and subject to such conditions as the Judge may consider expedient. [40/2019] (11) A Judge sitting in the General Division of the High Court must not make an order under subsection (10) unless he or she is satisfied that the inspection, copy or production is required for the purpose of instituting or maintaining a prosecution or an application under section 90 in connection with the election. [40/2019] (12) Except as provided in this section, no person is allowed to inspect any such ballot paper or document after it has been sealed up pursuant to subsection (9). 49A.

      "content": "62. —(1) On or before the day of nomination at an election, a person must be appointed in writing by or on behalf of each candidate as his or her agent for that election and the person is called in this Act the election agent. [Act 8 of 2023 wef 14/06/2024] (2) A candidate may appoint himself or herself as election agent, and is thereupon, so far as circumstances admit, subject to the provisions of this Act, both as a candidate and as an election agent, and any reference in this Act to an election agent is construed to refer to the candidate acting in his or her capacity as an election agent. [Act 8 of 2023 wef 14/06/2024] (2A) Where there is no appointment in force under subsection (1) or (2) of an election agent of a candidate for the election, the candidate must be treated, and so far as circumstances admit and subject to the provisions of this Act — ( a ) both as a candidate and as an election agent; and ( b ) as appointed under subsection (1) as his or her election agent for that election and deemed so declared under subsection (3), and any reference in this Act to an election agent is construed to refer to the candidate acting in his or her capacity as an election agent by virtue of this subsection. [Act 8 of 2023 wef 14/06/2024] (3) On or before the day of nomination, the name and address of the election agent of each candidate must be declared in writing by the candidate or some other person on the candidate’s behalf to the Returning Officer using either an electronic system or a form approved by the Returning Officer for the election. [Act 8 of 2023 wef 14/06/2024] (3A) The Returning Officer must then immediately, by affixing a notice in a conspicuous place outside the Returning Officer’s office, give public notification of the name and address of every election agent so declared or deemed declared. [Act 8 of 2023 wef 14/06/2024] (4) Only one person may hold an appointment as the election agent for a particular candidate at any one time, but the appointment, whether the election agent appointed be the candidate himself or herself or not, may be revoked. [Act 8 of 2023 wef 14/06/2024] (4A) In the event of such revocation or of the death of an election agent, whether the event is before, during or after the election, another election agent must immediately be appointed, and his or her name and address declared in writing to the Returning Officer, who must immediately give public notice of the name and address in the manner specified in subsection (3A). (5) A principal election agent for a group of candidates must be appointed by the candidates from among their election agents and the provisions of this section relating to the appointment and revocation of appointment of an election agent and public notification thereof apply, with the necessary modifications, in respect of a principal election agent. (5A) When there is no appointment in force under subsection (5) of a principal election agent for a group of candidates in an election, but there are appointments of election agents under subsection (1), (2) or (2A) in force, the election agent of the candidate whose name is to appear first in the group in the ballot papers under section 40(3)( a ), must be treated as appointed as the principal election agent of the group in relation to the election and deemed declared under subsection (3) as that principal election agent. [Act 8 of 2023 wef 14/06/2024] (6) The election agent of a candidate (called candidate A) belonging to a group of candidates may act by the election agent of any other candidate belonging to the same group (called a sub‑agent) whom the firstmentioned election agent authorises in writing in respect of such expenses incurred on account of or in respect of the conduct or management of the election for the candidates as are named in the authority, and — ( a ) anything done by or to the sub-agent is deemed to be done by the election agent and sub‑agent jointly; and ( b ) candidate A suffers the like incapacity as if any act or default of the sub‑agent had been the act or default of candidate A’s election agent. (7) To avoid doubt, nothing in subsection (6) prevents an election agent of a candidate belonging to a group from authorising in writing more than one sub-agent from among the respective election agents of the other candidates belonging to the same group. (8) The authorisation of a sub-agent under subsection (6) — ( a ) is not vacated by the election agent who authorised the sub‑agent ceasing to be an election agent; and ( b ) may be revoked by whoever is for the time being the election agent. (9) The references in sections 64, 65(1) and (1A), 66, 68 and 69 to an election agent of a candidate (called candidate A) are, in relation to an election in a group representation constituency, to be taken as references to the election agent — ( a ) acting by himself or herself; or ( b ) acting by the election agent of any other candidate belonging to the same group as candidate A whom the firstmentioned election agent has authorised in writing under subsection (6) to act as his or her sub‑agent in respect of such expenses incurred on account of or in respect of the conduct or management of the election for the candidates as are named in that authority.
