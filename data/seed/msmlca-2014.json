(8) Any term in an employment agreement providing for the seafarer to forego any part of the minimum annual leave prescribed under section 22 is unenforceable insofar as it purports to deprive the seafarer of that right or to remove or reduce the liability of the shipowner to grant the minimum annual leave prescribed under this Part except under such circumstances as may be prescribed by the Authority. (9) Either party to a seafarer’s employment agreement may at any time give to the other party notice of the firstmentioned party’s intention to terminate the agreement.
