[9/2012; 11/2018] [Act 27 of 2023 wef 01/01/2024] (6) If the person to whom a notice is given under subsection (4) fails to comply with the notice within the time specified, the Board may carry out the works specified in the notice in such manner as it thinks fit and recover as a debt due to it all expenses reasonably incurred in doing so from the person in default.

[9/2012] (7A) Nothing in this section prohibits the Board from carrying out any works specified in a notice under subsection (4) at the request of a person on whom the notice has been served, upon the person undertaking to pay the Board’s costs and expenses in carrying out the works. [Act 27 of 2023 wef 01/01/2024] (7B) Nothing in subsection (7A) imposes on the Board, directly or indirectly, any form of duty or liability enforceable by proceedings before any court to carry out the works mentioned in that subsection.
