(2) The right to commence an action under subsection (1) does not apply where — ( a ) the amount of the claim exceeds the prescribed limit; or ( b ) there is no claim for money, and the remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the prescribed limit. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)( a ), where the amount claimed consists of a balance not exceeding the prescribed limit after set-off of any amount claimed or recoverable by the supplier from the consumer, being a set-off admitted by the consumer in the particulars of his or her claim, the amount of the claim is not taken to exceed the prescribed limit. (4) For the purposes of subsection (2)( b ), where the subject matter in an action is a residential property, its value is — ( a ) the annual value of the immovable property appearing in the Valuation List prepared under section 10 of the Property Tax Act 1960; ( b ) the annual rent, or 12 times the monthly rent, payable by the tenant in respect of the immovable property (if this value is lower than the value in paragraph ( a )); or ( c ) if the annual value, annual rent or monthly rent cannot be ascertained, one-tenth of the last transacted price.

      "content": "7. —(1) Despite section 5(1)( a ) of the Small Claims Tribunals Act 1984, a Small Claims Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine — ( a ) any action under section 6(1) insofar as the action relates to an unfair practice involving a relevant contract; ( b ) any action under section 8(6), (7) or (8) insofar as the action relates to an undertaking in respect of an unfair practice involving a relevant contract; ( c ) any action under any regulations made under section 11 insofar as the action relates to a relevant contract, a time share contract or a time share related contract; ( d ) any action under any provisions specified under section 43(2)( j ), insofar as the action relates to a relevant contract; or ( e ) any action insofar as it relates to a deposit paid in relation to or in contemplation of a motor vehicle sale contract. [33/2018] (2) In subsection (1), “relevant contract” means a contract mentioned in paragraph 1( a ) or ( c ) of the Schedule to the Small Claims Tribunals Act 1984, but does not include a contract relating to the sale of immovable property. [33/2018] (3) To avoid doubt, subsections (1)( b ) and (2) to (5) of section 5 of the Small Claims Tribunals Act 1984 apply, with the necessary modifications, to a Small Claims Tribunal exercising the jurisdiction conferred by subsection (1). [33/2018] (4) For the purposes of determining whether an action under section 6(1) exceeds the District Court limit or the Magistrate’s Court limit within the meaning of the State Courts Act 1970, such an action is deemed to be a claim founded on contract. [5/2014] (5) Without prejudice to any other powers of the court to grant relief, a court (other than a Small Claims Tribunal) may in any proceedings where the court finds that a supplier has engaged in an unfair practice — ( a ) order restitution of any money, property or other consideration given or furnished by the consumer; ( b ) award the consumer damages in the amount of any loss or damage suffered by the consumer as a result of the unfair practice; ( c ) make an order of specific performance against the supplier; ( d ) make an order directing the supplier to repair goods or provide parts for goods; or ( e ) make an order varying the contract between the supplier and the consumer. (6) To avoid doubt, in an action under section 6(1) before a Small Claims Tribunal, the Tribunal may make orders pursuant to the provisions of the Small Claims Tribunals Act 1984. (7) Despite subsections (5) and (6), the court is not to grant any relief in respect of any goods or services intended for business use in an action under section 6(1). (8) For the purposes of subsection (7), the court may apportion the use of goods and services between business use and non‑business use as the court considers just and equitable in the circumstances of the case (even though the goods or services are indivisible) and grant relief only in respect of the portion of goods and services so attributed with non‑business use. (9) For the purposes of subsections (7) and (8) and section 39, goods or services intended for business use include — ( a ) goods or services (as the case may be) that the consumer intends to resell in the course of his or her business; and ( b ) goods that the consumer intends to use up or transform, in the course of his or her business, in a process of production or manufacturing or in repairing or treating other goods or fixtures, and “business use” and “non-business use” are construed accordingly. (10) Where the court finds that an unfair practice has occurred, the court must, in making an order in an action under section 6(1), have regard to whether or not the consumer made a reasonable effort to — ( a ) minimise any loss or damage resulting from the unfair practice; and ( b ) resolve the dispute with the supplier before commencing the action. (11) For the purposes of subsection (10)( b ), if any specified dispute resolution scheme was available to the consumer in respect of the dispute, the court must consider whether the consumer had sought to resolve the dispute through the scheme."
