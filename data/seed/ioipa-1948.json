[16/2016] (3) Where immunities and privileges are conferred on any persons by an order made under subsection (2), the President — ( a ) shall compile a list of the persons entitled to immunities and privileges conferred under subsection (2)( b ), and may compile a list of the persons entitled to immunities and privileges conferred under subsection (2)( c ); ( b ) shall cause any list compiled under this subsection to be published in the Gazette ; and ( c ) whenever any person ceases or begins to be entitled to the immunities and privileges to which any such list relates, shall amend the list and cause a notice of the amendment or, if the President thinks fit, an amended list to be published in the Gazette . (4) Every list or notice published under subsection (3) shall state the date from which the list or amendment takes or took effect; and the fact that any person is or was included or not included at any time among the persons entitled to the immunities and privileges in question may, if a list of those persons has been so published, be conclusively proved by producing the Gazette containing the list or, as the case may be, the last list taking effect before that time, together with the Gazettes (if any) containing notices of the amendments taking effect before that time, and by showing that the name of that person is or was at that time included or not included in that list."
