(2) The state of the art in the case of an invention is taken to comprise all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either, or anything else) which has at any time before the priority date of that invention been made available to the public (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) by written or oral description, by use or in any other way. (3) The state of the art in the case of an invention to which an application for a patent or a patent relates is taken also to comprise matter contained in an application for another patent which was published on or after the priority date of that invention, if the following conditions are satisfied: ( a ) that matter was contained in the application for that other patent both as filed and as published; and ( b ) the priority date of that matter is earlier than that of the invention. (4) For the purposes of this section, the disclosure of matter constituting an invention is to be disregarded in the case of a patent or an application for a patent if occurring later than the beginning of the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of filing the application for the patent and either — ( a ) the disclosure was due to, or made in consequence of, the matter having been obtained unlawfully or in breach of confidence by any person — (i) from the inventor or from any other person to whom the matter was made available in confidence by the inventor or who obtained it from the inventor because the other person or the inventor believed that the other person was entitled to obtain it; or (ii) from any other person ( A ) to whom the matter was made available in confidence by any person mentioned in sub‑paragraph (i) or in this sub‑paragraph or who obtained it from any person so mentioned because A or the person from whom A obtained it believed that A was entitled to obtain it; ( b ) the disclosure was made in breach of confidence by any person who obtained the matter in confidence from the inventor or from any other person to whom it was made available, or who obtained it, from the inventor; ( c ) the disclosure was due to, or made in consequence of, the inventor displaying the invention at an international exhibition; ( d ) the disclosure was due to, or made in consequence of, the inventor describing the invention in a paper read by the inventor or another person with the inventor’s consent or on the inventor’s behalf before any learned society or published with the inventor’s consent in the transactions of any learned society; or ( e ) subject to subsections (6) and (7), the disclosure was made to the public by the inventor, or by a person who obtained the matter directly or indirectly from the inventor, in any circumstances not described in paragraphs ( a ) to ( d ). [18/2017] (5) In subsection (4)( d ), “learned society” includes any club or association constituted in Singapore or elsewhere whose main object is the promotion of any branch of learning or science. (6) Subsection (4)( e ) applies to the disclosure of matter constituting an invention due to, or in consequence of, the publication by an intellectual property administrator (being a person who obtained the matter directly or indirectly from the inventor) of an application for an intellectual property right (being an application containing the matter, but not being the application for a patent mentioned in subsection (4)), or a registration of an intellectual property right pursuant to such an application, only if — ( a ) the application was filed, without the consent of the inventor, by a person who obtained the matter directly or indirectly from the inventor; or ( b ) the publication was erroneous by reason that — (i) the application had been withdrawn, refused or abandoned before the date of the publication; and (ii) consequently, the publication was not required under the law (whether of Singapore or elsewhere) or treaty governing the application. [18/2017] (7) For the purposes of subsection (4)( e ), where — ( a ) the disclosure of matter constituting an invention is due to, or in consequence of, the publication by an intellectual property administrator (being a person who obtained the matter directly or indirectly from the inventor) of an application for an intellectual property right (being an application containing the matter, but not being the application for a patent mentioned in subsection (4)), or a registration of an intellectual property right pursuant to such an application; and ( b ) the publication was erroneous by reason that the publication occurred earlier than provided under the law (whether of Singapore or elsewhere) or treaty governing the application, the matter is to be treated as disclosed to the public on the date when the publication should have occurred under that law or treaty. [18/2017] (8) If the applicant relies on any circumstances described in any paragraph of subsection (4) when — ( a ) complying with section 29(1)( b ) or ( c ), (3) or (9); or ( b ) making a request under section 29B(1) for a review of an examination report issued under section 29(4) or a search and examination report issued under section 29(5), the applicant must file written evidence complying with the prescribed requirements in support of the applicant’s reliance on those circumstances. [18/2017] (9) In this section, references to the inventor include references to any proprietor of the invention for the time being. (10) In the case of an invention consisting of a substance or composition for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body, the fact that the substance or composition forms part of the state of the art does not prevent the invention from being taken to be new if the use of the substance or composition in any such method does not form part of the state of the art.

[23/2019] (14) A decision of the Registrar to revoke a patent under this section has effect from the date of the grant of the patent.

(13) Where a product is disposed of to another in exercise of the rights conferred by subsection (10) or (12), that other and any person claiming through him may deal with the product in the same way as if it had been disposed of by the registered proprietor of the patent.

(2) In proceedings against any person for infringement of a patent, it is a defence to prove that at the time of the infringement there was in force a contract relating to the patent made by or with the consent of the claimant or a licence under the patent granted by or with the consent of the claimant and containing in either case a condition or term void by virtue of this section. [Act 25 of 2021 wef 01/04/2022] [Act 31 of 2022 wef 01/11/2022] (3) A condition or term of a contract or licence shall not be void by virtue of this section if — ( a ) at the time of the making of the contract or granting of the licence, the supplier or licensor was willing to supply the product, or grant a licence to work the invention, (as the case may be) to the person supplied or the licensee, on reasonable terms specified in the contract or licence and without any such condition or term as is mentioned in subsection (1); and ( b ) the person supplied or the licensee is entitled under the contract or licence to relieve himself, herself or itself of his, her or its liability to observe the condition or term on giving to the other party 3 months’ notice in writing, and subject to payment to that other party of such compensation (being, in the case of a contract to supply, a lump sum or rent for the residue of the term of the contract and, in the case of a licence, a royalty for the residue of the term of the licence) as may be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister. (4) If in any proceedings it is alleged that any condition or term of a contract or licence is void by virtue of this section, it shall lie on the supplier or licensor to prove the matters set out in subsection (3)( a ). (5) A condition or term of a contract or licence shall not be void by virtue of this section by reason only that it prohibits any person from selling goods other than those supplied by a specific person or, in the case of a contract for the hiring of or licence to use a patented product, that it reserves to the bailor or licensor, or the bailor’s or licensor’s nominee, the right to supply such new parts of the patented product as may be required to put or keep it in repair."

(2) In subsection (1), “patented product” and “patented invention” include respectively a product and an invention which is the subject of an application for a patent, and that subsection applies in relation to a patent by which any such product or invention was protected and which was granted after the time of the making of the contract or granting of the licence, on an application which had been filed before that time, as it applies to a patent in force at that time.

(2) Where a patent has been granted under the United Kingdom Patents Act 1977 not earlier than 36 months before, or not later than 12 months after, 23 February 1995, the proprietor of the patent may, within a period of 24 months from that date, make an application for a certificate of registration and the Registrar may issue a certificate on such application as if the Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act had not been repealed. (3) Any certificate of registration issued under section 5 of the repealed Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act and is in force immediately before 23 February 1995, or issued after that date by virtue of subsection (1) or (2) continues in force and the patent to which the certificate relates is treated for the purposes of this Act as if it were a patent under this Act granted pursuant to an application made under this Act and the proprietor of the patent accordingly has the same rights, remedies, privileges and obligations and subject to the same conditions (including the payment of any fee prescribed under section 36), as the proprietor of a patent under this Act subject to the following modifications: ( a ) the term of the patent dates from the date of the patent in the United Kingdom and the patent remains, subject to this Act, in force for 20 years from that date and only so long as the patent has not been revoked in the United Kingdom before 17 October 2001; ( b ) such other modifications as may be prescribed. (4) A patent to which subsection (3) applies is treated for the purposes of sections 14(3) and 17(2) as being granted on an application with a date of filing under this Act and published under this Act. (5) The date of filing an application for a patent as mentioned in subsection (4), and the priority date of an invention or other matter contained in that application, is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the United Kingdom Patents Act 1949 or 1977, as the case may be.
