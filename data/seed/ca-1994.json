(3) Any institution which no longer appears to the Commissioner to be a charity must be removed from the register with effect, where the removal is due to any change in its purposes or governing instruments, from the date of that change; and there must also be removed from the register any charity which ceases to exist or does not operate. [34/2010] (4) The Commissioner must refuse to register an institution as a charity — ( a ) if it appears to the Commissioner that the registration of the institution will be contrary to the public interest; or ( b ) on any other ground that the Minister may prescribe. (5) The Commissioner must remove an institution from the register of charities — ( a ) if it appears to the Commissioner that the continued registration of the institution as a charity is contrary to the public interest; or ( b ) on any other ground that the Minister may prescribe. (6) The following charities are not required to be registered: ( a ) any charity specified in the Schedule; and ( b ) any charity which is excepted by regulations made under this Act. (7) Any application to the Commissioner for a charity to be registered must be accompanied with copies of its governing instruments (or, if any provisions of the governing instruments are not set out in any document, particulars of them) and any other documents or information that the Commissioner may require for the purpose of the application. [34/2010] (8) It is the duty of — ( a ) the governing board members of any charity which is not registered nor excepted from registration to apply for it to be registered, and to supply the documents and information required by subsection (7), within 3 months after its establishment or such longer period as the Commissioner may allow; and ( b ) the governing board members (or last governing board members) of any institution which is for the time being registered to notify the Commissioner if it ceases to exist, or if there is any change in its governing instruments, or in its particulars entered in the register, and to furnish the Commissioner with particulars of any such change and copies of any new governing instruments or alterations of the governing instruments, within 7 days after such cessation or change or such longer period as the Commissioner may allow, and any person who makes default in carrying out any of the duties imposed by this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $100 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction, and the Commissioner may by order require that person to make good that default.

[40/2019] (5) Any question affecting the registration or removal from the register of an institution may, even though it has been determined by a decision on appeal under subsection (3), be considered afresh by the Commissioner and is not to be concluded by that decision, if it appears to the Commissioner that there has been a change of circumstances or that the decision is inconsistent with a later judicial decision, whether given on such an appeal or not.

[34/2010] (3) Any direction given by virtue of subsection (2)( a ) must be given within 12 months of the time when the registered name was entered in the register in respect of the charity. (4) Any direction given under this section with respect to a charity must be given to the governing board members; and on receiving any such direction the governing board members must give effect to it despite anything in the governing instruments of the charity. [34/2010] (5) Where the name of any charity is changed under this section, it is the duty of the governing board members to notify the Commissioner, within 7 days after the change or such longer period as the Commissioner may allow, of the new name of the charity and of the date on which the change occurred. [34/2010] (6) A change of name by a charity under this section does not affect any rights or obligations of the charity; and any legal proceedings that might have been continued or commenced by or against it in its former name may be continued or commenced by or against it in its new name. (7) Any reference in this section to the governing board members of a charity is, in relation to a charity which is a company, to be read as a reference to the directors of the company. [34/2010] (8) Where any direction is given under this section with respect to a charity which is a company, the direction is taken to require the directors of the company to take the necessary steps to effect the change of the name of the company, including applying to the Registrar of Companies for the reservation and approval of the new name under section 27 or 378 of the Companies Act 1967, as the case may be.

(3) For the purposes of this section, property is conclusively presumed (without any advertisement or inquiry) to belong to donors who cannot be identified, insofar as it consists of the proceeds of — ( a ) cash collections made by means of collecting boxes or by other means not adapted for distinguishing one gift from another; or ( b ) any lottery, competition, entertainment, sale or similar money‑raising activity, after allowing for property given to provide prizes or articles for sale or otherwise to enable the activity to be undertaken. (4) The General Division of the High Court may by order direct that property not falling within subsection (3) is, for the purposes of this section, to be treated (without any advertisement or inquiry) as belonging to donors who cannot be identified, where it appears to the General Division of the High Court — ( a ) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the amounts likely to be returned to the donors, to incur expense with a view to returning the property; or ( b ) that it would be unreasonable, having regard to the nature, circumstances and amount of the gifts, and to the lapse of time since the gifts were made, for the donors to expect the property to be returned. [40/2019] (5) Where property is applied cy-pr&#232;s by virtue of this section, the donor is deemed to have parted with all the donor’s interest at the time when the gift was made; but where property is so applied as belonging to donors who cannot be identified or cannot be found, and is not so applied by virtue of subsection (3) or (4) — ( a ) the scheme must specify the total amount of that property; ( b ) the donor of any part of that amount is entitled, if the donor makes a claim not later than 6 months after the date on which the scheme is made, to recover from the charity for which the property is applied a sum equal to that part, less any expenses properly incurred by the governing board members of the charity after that date in connection with claims relating to the donor’s gift; and ( c ) the scheme may include directions as to the provision to be made for meeting any such claim. [34/2010] (6) Where — ( a ) any sum is, in accordance with any directions in a scheme, set aside for meeting any such claims; but ( b ) the aggregate amount of any such claims actually made exceeds the relevant amount, then if the Commissioner so directs, each of the donors in question is entitled only to such proportion of the relevant amount as the amount of the donor’s claim bears to the aggregate amount referred to in paragraph ( b ); and for this purpose, “relevant amount” means the amount of the sum so set aside after deduction of any expenses properly incurred by the governing board members of the charity in connection with claims relating to the donors’ gifts. [34/2010] (7) For the purposes of this section, charitable purposes are deemed to fail where any difficulty in applying property to those purposes makes that property or the part not applicable cy‑pr&#232;s available to be returned to the donors.

[2/2018] (8) The Commissioner may, by order made of his or her own motion, appoint a person to be a governing board member or key officer — ( a ) in place of a governing board member or key officer removed by the Commissioner under this section or otherwise; ( b ) where there are no governing board members, or where by reason of vacancies in their number or the absence or incapacity of any of their number the charity cannot apply for the appointment; ( c ) where there is a single governing board member or key officer, not being a corporation, and the Commissioner is of the opinion that it is necessary to increase the number for the proper administration of the charity; or ( d ) where the Commissioner is of the opinion that it is necessary for the proper administration of the charity to have an additional governing board member or key officer, because one of the existing governing board members or key officers who ought nevertheless to remain a governing board member or key officer cannot be found or does not act or is outside Singapore. [34/2010] (9) The powers of the Commissioner under this section to remove or appoint governing board members or trustees for a charity include the power to make any order with respect to the vesting in or transfer to the governing board members or trustees for a charity of any property as the Commissioner may make on the removal or appointment of a governing board member or trustee for the charity by the Commissioner under section 22. [34/2010] (10) Any order under this section for the removal or appointment of a governing board member or trustee for a charity, or for the vesting or transfer of any property, has the like effect as an order made under section 22. [34/2010] (11) Section 22(4) applies to orders under this section as it applies to orders under section 22. (12) An order of suspension under subsection (2)( c ) must be for a fixed period, but the Commissioner may make one or more further extensions of that order, each for a fixed period. [2/2018] (13) The total period of suspension under an order of suspension under subsection (2)( c ) and every extension under subsection (12) of such an order must not exceed 24 months. [2/2018] (14) Without affecting section 47, any order of suspension under subsection (2)( c ) and any extension under subsection (12) may make provision for any matter arising out of the suspension; and if there is any inconsistency amongst the provisions made by any of the orders, the latest in time prevails. [2/2018] (15) For the purposes of subsection (14), provision may be made in particular — ( a ) to enable any person to execute any instrument in the name of the person suspended or to otherwise act for the person suspended; and ( b ) in the case of a governing board member of a charity, for adjusting any rules governing the proceedings of the governing board members to take account of the reduction in the number capable of acting. [2/2018] (16) Before exercising any jurisdiction under this section (otherwise than by virtue of subsection (2) or (5)), the Commissioner must give notice of his or her intention to do so to — ( a ) each of the governing board members; and ( b ) in the case of an order — (i) for the removal of any trustee for the charity or key officer; (ii) for the appointment of an additional trustee for the charity or a key officer; or (iii) for the transfer of any property, each trustee for the charity or key officer concerned, except those who cannot be found or who have no known address in Singapore. [34/2010; 2/2018] (17) Before exercising any jurisdiction under subsection (5), the Commissioner must give notice of the Commissioner’s intention to do so to — ( a ) the person against whom the Commissioner proposes to make the order under that subsection, unless the person cannot be found or has no known address in Singapore; and ( b ) each of the governing board members of the charity from which the person resigned, if the Commissioner thinks it necessary to do so. [2/2018] (18) A notice referred to in subsection (16) or (17) may be given by post and, if given by post, may be addressed to the last known address in Singapore of the governing board member or trustee for the charity or key officer or person, as the case may be. [34/2010; 2/2018] (19) The Commissioner must, at such intervals as he or she thinks fit, review any order made by the Commissioner under subsection (2)( c ), ( e ), ( f ), ( g ), ( h ) or ( i ); and if on any such review it appears to the Commissioner that it would be appropriate to discharge the order in whole or in part, he or she must so discharge it (whether subject to any saving or transitional provisions or not). (20) Any person who contravenes an order under subsection (2)( f ), ( g ) or ( h ) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both. [2/2018] (21) Nothing in subsection (20) is to be taken to preclude the bringing of proceedings for breach of trust against any governing board member or trustee for a charity in respect of a contravention of an order under subsection (2)( f ) or ( h ) (whether proceedings in respect of the contravention are brought against the governing board member or trustee under subsection (20)). [34/2010] (22) This section does not apply to an exempt charity. [25"
