[14/2013] (11) In considering whether it is necessary for the safety of persons for the premises to be closed immediately or whether a danger has been alleviated, in relation to the application of this section to a fire hazard, the Commissioner or the Magistrate’s Court (as the case may be) may consider whether — ( a ) that fire hazard is likely to recur in or on the premises; and ( b ) that fire hazard, if it were to recur in or on the premises, would — (i) constitute an immediate or substantial danger of fire in or on the premises; or (ii) be likely, if a fire breaks out in or on the premises, to increase the normal risk to life which occurs in the event of a fire.
