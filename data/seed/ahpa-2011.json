(4) Where a Disciplinary Tribunal has made an order under section 53(2)( c ) or ( d ), the Disciplinary Tribunal or another Disciplinary Tribunal appointed in its place may revoke the order or revoke or vary any of the conditions or restrictions imposed by the order. (5) Subsection (1) applies to a registered allied health professional whose registration is subject to conditions or restrictions imposed by an order made under subsection (2) or (3) as it applies to a registered allied health professional whose registration is subject to conditions or restrictions imposed by an order made under section 53(2)( c ) or ( d ), and subsection (4) applies accordingly. (6) Where a Disciplinary Tribunal has made an order under section 53 or this section, or has varied the conditions or restrictions imposed by an order under this section, the Registrar must immediately serve on the registered allied health professional and on the complainant a notice of the order or the variation. (7) Subject to subsection (8), an order made by a Disciplinary Tribunal for the removal of the name of a registered allied health professional from the appropriate register or for the suspension of his or her registration under subsection (1) or (3) or section 53(2) does not take effect until the expiry of 30 days after the order is made. (8) On making an order for the removal of the name of a registered allied health professional from the appropriate register or for the suspension of his or her registration under subsection (1) or (3) or section 53(2), a Disciplinary Tribunal, if satisfied that to do so is necessary for the protection of members of the public or would be in the best interests of the registered allied health professional concerned, may order the Registrar to remove his or her name from the register or that his or her registration in the register be suspended immediately. (9) Where an order under subsection (8) is made, the Registrar must immediately serve a notice of the order on the person to whom it applies and — ( a ) if that person was present or represented at the proceedings of the Disciplinary Tribunal, the order takes effect from the time the order is made; or ( b ) if that person was neither present nor represented at the proceedings of the Disciplinary Tribunal, the order takes effect from the date the notice is served on him or her. (10) An order of a Disciplinary Tribunal, other than an order for the removal of a name or for the suspension of a registration under subsection (1) or (3) or section 53(2)( a ) or ( b ), takes effect from the date the order is made. (11) While any order of suspension of registration remains in force, the person concerned is not to be regarded as being registered, even though the person’s name still appears in a register, but immediately on the expiry of the order, the person’s rights and privileges as a registered allied health professional are revived as from the date of the expiry provided that the registered allied health professional has complied with all the terms of the order."

[40/2019] (2) A complainant who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Disciplinary Tribunal may, within 30 days from the lapse of the period for appeal in subsection (1), provided the complainant has not received notice of the Council’s decision to file an appeal to the General Division of the High Court, apply to a Review Committee to direct the Council to file an appeal to the General Division of the High Court.
