[6/2017] (10) After the Returning Officer has made any declaration under subsection (8) or (8D), the Returning Officer must ensure that the following procedures are complied with at every counting place and principal counting place: ( a ) all ballot papers and all other documents relating to the election at every counting place and principal counting place must be sealed up in separate packets and placed in any ballot box or boxes; ( b ) the ballot box or boxes must then be sealed with the seal of the Returning Officer and the seals of such of the candidates or their counting agents as attend and desire to affix their seals; ( c ) the sealed ballot box or boxes must be despatched and delivered in safe custody to the Returning Officer; ( d ) subject to subsection (11), the ballot papers and other documents in the sealed ballot box or boxes must be retained in safe custody for a period of 6 months; ( e ) the ballot papers and other documents must be destroyed at the end of the period of 6 months unless otherwise directed by order of the President.
