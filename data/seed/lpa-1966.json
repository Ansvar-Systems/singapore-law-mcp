(2) Where the requirements mentioned in subsection (4) are complied with in relation to a conditional fee agreement, the agreement — ( a ) is not unenforceable by reason only of its being a conditional fee agreement; and ( b ) is not contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal, by reason only that it is a contract for maintenance or champerty. (3) The consequences for failure to comply with all of the requirements mentioned in subsection (4) are set out in section 115D. (4) The requirements mentioned in subsections (2) and (3) are as follows: ( a ) the conditional fee agreement must be in writing and signed by the client; ( b ) the conditional fee agreement must not provide for the remuneration or costs to be payable as a percentage or proportion of the amount of damages or other amounts awarded to or recovered by the client in any contentious proceedings; ( c ) any other requirement prescribed under subsection (7).

(6) To avoid doubt, a conditional fee agreement may provide for the whole or any part of the remuneration and costs payable in specified circumstances to include remuneration and costs incurred in relation to — ( a ) preliminary and preparatory advice and other legal services for the purposes of and before the commencement of any contemplated prescribed proceedings even if those proceedings are eventually not commenced or if the claim or dispute in those proceedings is settled; or ( b ) negotiations or settlement of a claim or dispute for the purposes of any contemplated prescribed proceedings even if those proceedings are eventually not commenced or if the claim or dispute in those proceedings is settled. (7) The Minister may make regulations necessary or convenient for carrying out or giving effect to this Part, including regulations to prescribe any of the following: ( a ) the class or classes or descriptions of contentious proceedings to which a conditional fee agreement may relate; ( b ) requirements relating to the form of a conditional fee agreement; ( c ) requirements relating to the terms and conditions of a conditional fee agreement; ( d ) requirements relating to maximum limits on the remuneration or costs (including the uplift fee) that may be charged under a conditional fee agreement determined or calculated by reference to a prescribed amount, a prescribed fixed or hourly rate or a percentage of the prescribed amount or rate or any combination thereof; ( e ) requirements relating to prescribed information that must be provided to a client before any conditional fee agreement is entered into; ( f ) requirements relating to a party to a conditional fee agreement.

(9) If in a case mentioned in subsection (8), the client pays the whole or any part of the amount payable under the conditional fee agreement without the previous allowance of the Registrar or the General Division of the High Court — ( a ) the client is liable at any time to account for the amount charged to the estate or property mentioned in subsection (8); and ( b ) the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity that accepted the payment may be ordered by the court mentioned in subsection (2) to refund the amount received by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity.
