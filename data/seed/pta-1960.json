      "title": "Charge of property tax",
      "content": "6. —(1) As from 1 January 1961, a property tax is, subject to the provisions of this Act, payable at the rate or rates specified in this Act for each year upon the annual value of all houses, buildings, lands and tenements whatsoever included in the Valuation List and amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Act. (2) The tax is payable by the owner of such property — ( a ) in the case of tax payable under subsection (1), yearly in advance without demand, in the month of January; and ( b ) without affecting paragraph ( a ), where the Comptroller has served a notice for payment of the tax under this Act, within one month of the service of that notice. (3) The Comptroller may extend the period for payment referred to in subsection (2) within which payment of the tax is to be made. (4) The tax is a first charge on the property concerned and, if not paid within the prescribed time, is recoverable in the manner provided in this Act. (5) No tax is payable on any house, land, building or tenement the annual value of which is $18 or less. (6) Where the Comptroller is satisfied that a building or any part thereof is used exclusively — ( a ) as a place for public religious worship; ( b ) for a public school which is in receipt of grants‑in‑aid from the Government; ( c ) for charitable purposes; or ( d ) for purposes conducive to social development in Singapore, the building or such part thereof (as the case may be) is exempt from payment of the tax. [23/2010] (7) Where the Comptroller is satisfied that land is used or will be developed or is being developed into a building for use principally for any purpose specified in subsection (6), the land is exempt from payment of the tax. (8) The Minister may exempt, subject to such conditions as the Minister thinks fit, any premises or part thereof from the payment of the tax. (9) The Minister may, by order in the Gazette , remit or exempt wholly or in part the tax payable in respect of such category of properties for such period and subject to such conditions as the Minister may specify in the order. (10) Where premises are held subject to the payment by the owner thereof of any rent, rentcharge, annuity or other like payment, the owner having paid the tax for the time being payable on the premises is entitled, despite any stipulation to the contrary, to deduct from the rent, rentcharge, annuity or other payment a sum which bears the same proportion to the tax so paid by the owner as the amount of that rent, rentcharge, annuity or other payment bears to the annual value of the premises. (11) No deduction under subsection (10) may be made from any rent payable to the Government or to a public authority. (12) Despite any other provision in this Act, the Minister may, in respect of any public authority or body corporate constituted under any written law, order that in lieu of the tax payable under this Act, the public authority or body corporate must — ( a ) in a case equivalent to the payment of tax under subsection (1), yearly in advance without demand, in the month of January; and ( b ) without affecting paragraph ( a ), where the Comptroller has served a notice for payment, within one month of the service of that notice, pay to the Government the sum of which is to be calculated on such basis as may be deemed equitable by the Minister. (13) If such sum remains due and unpaid at the end of 3 weeks from the end of January in each year or from the end of one month from the date of the service of a notice for payment of the tax (as the case may be) it is deemed to be arrears of tax payable and may be recovered in the manner provided in this Act together with interest at such rate as may be prescribed. [23/2010] (14) If it is proved to the satisfaction of the Comptroller that any tax has been paid in excess of the amount with which any property is properly chargeable, the owner of the property is entitled to have the amount so paid in excess refunded. (15) Every claim for such refund under subsection (14) must be made within 5 years of such excess payment. [23/2010] (16) The Comptroller must certify the amount to be refunded and must cause payment to be made immediately. (17) Where any amount has been erroneously refunded under subsection (16), the owner must, despite the certification by the Comptroller of such refund, repay that amount within a period of 15 days of the owner receiving a demand therefor from the Comptroller. (18) If that amount remains due and unpaid at the expiry of that period mentioned in subsection (17), it is deemed to be arrears of tax payable in respect of the property concerned and may be recovered in the manner provided in this Act."

(5) Each part of a partially completed building divided laterally or horizontally into parts is for the purposes of this Part deemed to be a building if it is used for human habitation or otherwise.

[18/2013] [Act 33 of 2022 wef 04/11/2022] (2) On receipt of any such notice, the Chief Assessor may require the production of the instrument of sale or transfer, if any. (3) When any building or any part of a building which is liable to the payment of tax is demolished or removed, the owner must, within 15 days from the completion of the demolition or removal, give written notice thereof to the Chief Assessor. (4) Where any building or part of a building is demolished or removed and no action has been taken to amend the Valuation List in respect thereof for any reason, the owner must, at the option of the Comptroller — ( a ) continue to be liable to pay the tax in respect of the building or part of the building, as if the building had not been demolished or removed; or ( b ) even if the Valuation List has not been amended, be liable to pay the tax in respect of that property from the date of demolition or removal of the building (as the case may be) on the basis of any revised annual value which may be ascribed to that property in a subsequent amended Valuation List. (5) Where there is — ( a ) a letting of any property; ( b ) an increase in any rent charged for the letting of the property; or ( c ) an increase in any sum charged — (i) for the use of furniture, fixtures, fittings and other furnishings in the property; (ii) for the maintenance of the property and the grounds thereof; or (iii) for services provided in connection with the property, the owner of the property must, within 15 days after the letting or the increase, give written notice thereof to the Chief Assessor. [23/2010] (6) Where any property is let and a premium is charged for the letting of the property, the owner thereof must, within 15 days of the receipt of the premium, give written notice to the Chief Assessor. (7) Subsections (5) and (6) do not apply where the instrument (in relation to the letting or the increase, as the case may be) — ( a ) is chargeable with duty under the Stamp Duties Act 1929; and ( b ) is stamped under that Act within the 15‑day period referred to in subsection (5) or (6), as the case may be. [23/2010] (8) When any property ceases to be occupied by the owner, the owner of the property must, within 15 days of ceasing to occupy the property, give written notice thereof to the Chief Assessor. (9) Without affecting subsection (8), where there has been a change in the prescribed class of any property referred to in section 9(3), the owner of the property must, within 15 days after the date of the change, give written notice thereof to the Chief Assessor, unless the Minister, in an order referred to in section 9(2) — ( a ) prescribes a period longer than 15 days; or ( b ) provides that no notice need be given. [18/2013] (10) Despite a change in the prescribed class of any property referred to in section 9(3), the owner of the property continues to be liable to pay the tax in respect of the property the owner had been paying immediately prior to the change as if no change had occurred until the owner’s liability is adjusted under subsection (11), or subsections (11) and (12). [18/2013] (11) Where the Comptroller becomes aware of the change in the prescribed class of any property, the owner of the property is liable, as from the date of the change, to pay the tax on the basis of the rate or rates applicable to the property following the change. [18/2013] (12) Without affecting subsection (11), where there is a revised annual value ascribed to the property in a subsequent amended Valuation List pursuant to the change in the prescribed class of the property, the owner of the property is liable, as from the date of the change and at the option of the Comptroller, to pay the tax on the revised annual value. [18/2013] (13) For the purposes of subsections (9) to (12), where planning permission (other than provisional permission) for the making of any material change in the use of the property or part thereof (as the case may be) is given by the competent authority under the Planning Act 1998 and the circumstances for which such permission is sought correspond to any circumstances resulting in the change in the prescribed class of the property, then the date of the planning permission is prima facie evidence of the date of the change in the prescribed class of the property. [18/2013] (14) No tax is payable or refundable, as the case may be — ( a ) under subsection (11) or (12) in respect of any period which is more than 5 years prior to 1 January of the year in which a notice of amendment to the Valuation List under section 20 is issued pursuant to the change in the prescribed class of the property; or ( b ) under subsection (11) in respect of any period which is more than 5 years prior to 1 January of the year in which the Chief Assessor considers it not desirable that an amendment be made to the Valuation List in respect of the property despite the change in the prescribed class thereof. [18/2013] (15) Any person who fails to give any notice required by this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000. (16) Any owner who fails to give any notice required by this section and who subsequently becomes liable to pay tax pursuant to section 21 must pay interest on the tax at such rate as may be prescribed. (17) The interest payable under subsection (16) is to be calculated from the date of expiry of the period during which the notice is to be given and is deemed to be tax payable and recoverable under this Act."

(2) For the purposes of this section, the Valuation List is deemed to be inaccurate in a material particular where — ( a ) the Chief Assessor is of the opinion that the annual value of a property included in the Valuation List does not correctly represent the annual value evidenced by — (i) the rental obtained from a tenant in respect of a property previously vacant or previously occupied by the owner; (ii) the increased or decreased rental obtained in respect of the letting out of that or similar property; (iii) the consideration paid or value passing on the sale or transfer, directly or indirectly, of any estate or interest in that or similar property, including the sale or transfer of 75% or more of the issued ordinary shares of a land‑owning company, whether or not the Chief Assessor exercises the option given in section 2(6); (iv) the development cost of that or similar property; or (v) the gross takings or receipts derived from the use of that or similar property; ( b ) the Chief Assessor is of the opinion that the rental (if any) obtained from the tenant is lower than the gross amount at which the property could reasonably be expected to be let from year to year; ( c ) any new building or tenement is erected or any building or tenement is rebuilt, enlarged, altered, improved or demolished; ( d ) there is any change in the prescribed class of any property referred to in section 9(3); ( e ) any property or part thereof, not exempted from the provisions of this Act, has not been included in the Valuation List; or ( f ) the Chief Assessor is of the opinion that the annual value of any property or part thereof in the Valuation List required to be assessed on the basis of gross receipts by any order made under section 7 does not correctly represent the annual value as evidenced by the gross receipts arising from the use of that property for the purposes of any trade or business and determined in the manner specified in the order. [23/2010; 18/2013] (3) The Chief Assessor may cancel any notice given under subsection (1) which is inaccurate in any material particular and may replace it with another notice. (4) Any alteration to a Valuation List required for the purpose of correcting any of the matters referred to in section 10(3)( a ), ( b ) and ( d ) or for the correction of any clerical or arithmetical error therein does not in itself constitute an amendment and may be made at any time. (5) The Chief Assessor may, if the Chief Assessor is satisfied that there is any clerical or arithmetic error in the Valuation List in respect of the annual value ascribed to any house, building, land or tenement — ( a ) make an alteration to the Valuation List to correct the error; and ( b ) cancel any notice given under subsection (1) and replace it with another notice to correct such error, except that no such alteration or cancellation may be in respect of any annual value for any period of more than 5 years prior to the date on which the Chief Assessor has ascertained that such an error exists. [23/2010] (6) In this section, “land-owning company” means a company the main object or one of the main objects of which is the development of property by the construction of houses or buildings thereon for the purpose of sale or rent."

(2) The Comptroller must not proceed under subsection (1)( b ) to sell the premises in respect of which the arrears are due, or any portion thereof or interest therein, where there is or are upon the premises and liable to be seized and sold under subsection (1)( a ) movable property or crops belonging to the owner of a value estimated by the Comptroller to be sufficient to realise the sum required to satisfy the arrears and costs. (3) Any tenant, subtenant or occupier ( X ) who, in order to avoid the seizure or sale of X ’s property for non‑payment of arrears payable by the owner of the premises, pays the arrears and costs may thereafter, in the absence of any written agreement to the contrary, deduct the amount so paid by X from the rent due or to become due by X to X ’s immediate landlord on account of the premises or such part thereof as is held or occupied by X , and may retain possession thereof until that amount has been fully reimbursed to X whether by deduction from the rent or otherwise. (4) Any tenant or subtenant ( X ) who has reimbursed (whether by allowing a deduction from the rent or otherwise) any subtenant or occupier ( Y ) holding or occupying under X the amount so paid by Y has a similar right to deduct that amount from the rent due or to become due to X ’s immediate landlord and to retain possession until similarly reimbursed. (5) The receipt of the Comptroller or of any duly authorised officer of his or her department for any amount so paid by any such tenant, subtenant or occupier is deemed an acquittance in full for the like amount of rent. (6) If any premises in respect of which arrears are due, or any such movable property or crops as are mentioned in subsection (1) or the proceeds of sale thereof are already in the custody of the law under any enforcement order whereby the Comptroller is unable to exercise the powers under this section, the Comptroller may notify the Sheriff or the bailiff of the court concerned of the amount of the arrears, and is entitled without obtaining a judgment to be paid such amount out of the proceeds of sale of that premises or property in priority to the judgment debtor and to the judgment creditor and to any other creditor, except the Government. [Act 25 of 2021 wef 01/04/2022] (7) A certificate from the Comptroller is, unless it is disputed by the judgment debtor, conclusive evidence of the amount of the arrears, and in case of dispute, the amount is to be summarily determined by the court concerned. (8) Where premises are sold under subsection (1)( b ), the Comptroller has power to execute the conveyance and the purchaser of the premises must not be concerned to inquire whether the provisions of this Act relating to the sale and the conveyance have been complied with nor otherwise to inquire into the regularity or validity of the sale and conveyance. (9) Subsection (8) — ( a ) is deemed to apply to all conveyances executed by the Comptroller before 17 August 1973, and all such conveyances so executed are accordingly deemed always to have been or to be validly executed; and ( b ) does not affect the application of section 144 of the Land Titles Act 1993 in relation to registered land."
