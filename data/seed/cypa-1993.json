[30/2019] (6) In deciding whether an accused’s relationship with a young person of 16 years of age or older but below 18 years of age is exploitative of the young person for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), the court is to have regard to all of the following: ( a ) the age of the minor; ( b ) the difference between the age of the accused and the young person; ( c ) the nature of the relationship; ( d ) the degree of control or influence exercised by the accused over the young person.

[30/2019] (8) For the purposes of subsection (6) and subject to subsection (9), it is presumed until the contrary is proved that an accused’s relationship with a young person of 16 years of age or older but below 18 years of age is exploitative where the relationship is any of the following: ( a ) the accused is a parent, step‑parent, guardian or foster parent of the young person; ( b ) the accused is the de facto partner of a parent, guardian or foster parent of the young person; ( c ) the accused is a member of the teaching or management staff of the school or educational institution at which the young person is a student; ( d ) the accused has an established personal relationship with the young person in connection with the provision of religious, sporting, musical or other instruction to the young person; ( e ) the accused is a custodial officer of an institution in which the young person is detained; ( f ) the accused is a registered medical practitioner, a registered traditional Chinese medicine practitioner or a psychologist and the young person is a patient of the accused; ( g ) the accused is an advocate and solicitor or a counsellor and the young person is a client of the accused.

[30/2019] (2) For the purposes of an order under subsection (1)( b ), the Youth Court may further order that the determination by the Director‑General or protector as to the fit person to whom, or the place of safety or place of temporary care and protection to which, the child or young person is committed may be varied by the Director‑General or a protector (who may or may not have made the determination) during the period of the child’s or young person’s committal, even though the variation may result in the child or young person being committed to a different care‑provider, if the Director‑General or protector (as the case may be) thinks that it is in the best interests of the child or young person to do so. [30/2019] (3) Where — ( a ) a Youth Court has ordered the committal of a child or young person to the care of a fit person, or a place of safety or place of temporary care and protection (called in this subsection and subsection (4) the principal care‑provider) under subsection (1)( b ); and ( b ) the principal care‑provider is unable to provide care for the child or young person for a period that is at least 8 weeks, the Director‑General or protector may arrange for the child or young person to be committed to the temporary care of another fit person, or a place of safety or place of temporary care and protection during that period, whether or not the arrangement would result in the child or young person being committed to a different care‑provider. [30/2019] (4) An arrangement by the Director‑General or a protector under subsection (3) is not to be treated as a variation under subsection (2) if the child or young person is returned to the principal care‑provider before the end of the arrangement under subsection (3). [30/2019] (5) Where any parent or guardian of the child or young person disagrees with a determination of the Director‑General or a protector under subsection (1)( b ) or a variation of the determination under subsection (2), the parent or guardian (as the case may be) may apply to the Youth Court to review the determination or variation. [30/2019] (6) After reviewing a determination under subsection (1)( b ) or variation under subsection (2), the Youth Court may order that the child or young person be committed to the care of such fit person, or to such place of safety or place of temporary care and protection as specified by the Court. [30/2019] (7) Where 3 variations have been made by the Director‑General or a protector under subsection (2) in respect of a child or young person before the expiry of the period specified by the Youth Court under subsection (1)( b )(i), and the Director‑General or a protector is of the view that a further variation during that period is necessary, the Director‑General or protector must apply to the Court for an order as to the appropriate fit person to whom, or the appropriate place of safety or place of temporary care and protection to which, the child or young person is to be committed. [30/2019] (8) A Youth Court may, in making any order under subsection (1), impose such conditions or give such directions as it thinks fit for the purpose of ensuring the safety and well-being of the child or young person in respect of whom such order is made, and every person upon whom such conditions are imposed or to whom such directions are given must comply with such conditions or directions. [27/2014] (9) No order under subsection (1) may be made without giving the parent or guardian of the child or young person an opportunity to attend and be heard. (10) Where the Youth Court considers the presence of a child or young person or his or her parent or guardian to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of the proceedings, the Court may compel the attendance of the child or young person or his or her parent or guardian by summons. [3/2011; 27/2014] (11) The Youth Court may dispense with the attendance of a child or young person in Court if it considers that the prejudicial effects (if any) of dispensing with his or her attendance is outweighed by any harm or injury to or any other detrimental effect on the welfare of the child or young person that will or may be caused to him or her by his or her attendance in Court. [3/2011; 27/2014] (12) Despite subsection (9), an order under subsection (1) may be made if the parent or guardian of the child or young person, having been required to attend, has failed to do so or cannot be found within a reasonable time. (13) In determining what order to be made under subsection (1), the Youth Court is to treat the welfare of the child or young person as the paramount consideration and is to endeavour to obtain such information as to the family background, general conduct, home environment, school record, medical history and state of development of the child or young person as may enable the Court to deal with the case in the best interests of the child or young person. [3/2011; 27/2014] (14) For the purpose of subsection (13), the Youth Court may — ( a ) require any person who, in the opinion of the Court, is able to furnish any information regarding the child or young person to furnish to the Court such information as the Court may specify; ( b ) require the parent or guardian of the child or young person to render such assistance to the Court as the Court thinks necessary; ( c ) order the child or young person to be sent for an assessment by a registered medical practitioner or an approved welfare officer; ( d ) require the parent or guardian of the child or young person to undergo such medical, psychiatric, psychological or other assessment as the Court thinks necessary; and ( e ) from time to time adjourn the case for such period as it thinks necessary and make in respect of the child or young person, as an interim order having effect only during the period of adjournment, any order which it could have made under subsection (1). [3/2011; 27/2014] (15) Where the Youth Court requires any child or young person or the parent or guardian of a child or young person to undergo any assessment under subsection (14)( c ) or ( d ) — ( a ) the person carrying out the assessment must provide a written report to the Court, the Director‑General or a protector stating the results of the person’s assessment, and such report may be received and considered by the Court without being read aloud; and ( b ) the costs of and incidental to any such assessment must be borne by the parent or guardian of the child or young person, unless the Court directs otherwise. [3/2011; 27/2014; 30/2019] (16) If the Youth Court is not satisfied that the child or young person brought before it is in need of protection, the Court may order that the child or young person be returned to the care and custody of his or her parent or guardian. [27/2014] (17) The Youth Court may, at any time before the expiry of an order made under subsection (1) and on the application of the Director‑General or a protector, vary the period of the order or discharge the order if the Court is satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the person in respect of whom the order was made. [3/2011; 27/2014; 30/2019] (18) To avoid doubt, where an order to be varied or discharged under subsection (17) is an order made under subsection (1)( b ) or ( c ) and involves a person who is older than 18 years of age (but below 21 years of age) at the time the order is to be varied or discharged, the Youth Court is not to extend the period for which the person is to be committed to the care of a fit person or to a place of safety or place of temporary care and protection, or placed under the supervision of the Director‑General, a protector, an approved welfare officer or a person appointed by the Court, as the case may be. [30/2019] (19) If the parent or guardian of the child or young person fails to enter into the bond within the time specified in the order made under subsection (1)( a ) or breaches any condition of the bond, the parent or guardian shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000.

[30/2019] (7) The Youth Court may dispense with the attendance of a child or young person in Court if it considers that the prejudicial effects (if any) of dispensing with his or her attendance is outweighed by any harm or injury to or any other detrimental effect on the welfare of the child or young person that will or may be caused to him or her by his or her attendance in Court.

[30/2019] (2) An application made under subsection (1) must be accompanied by a recommendation of an approved welfare officer. [30/2019] (3) A Youth Court may in any appropriate case do either or both of the following: ( a ) dispense with the requirement mentioned in subsection (1)( b ); ( b ) if the Court dispenses with the requirement mentioned in subsection (1)( b ), order the parent or guardian, and the child or young person to complete the family programme at any stage of the proceedings. [30/2019] (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Youth Court may order that the child or young person — ( a ) be placed under the supervision of an approved welfare officer or some other person appointed for the purpose by the Court for a period not exceeding 3 years; ( b ) be committed to the care of a fit person for a period not exceeding 3 years; or ( c ) be committed to the care of a place of safety for a period not exceeding 3 years. [30/2019] (5) An order under subsection (4)( b ) or ( c ) may provide that — ( a ) the fit person to whom, or the place of safety to which, the child or young person is to be committed (called in this section a care‑provider), be determined by the Director‑General or a protector; and ( b ) the determination under paragraph ( a ) may be varied by the Director‑General, a protector or an approved welfare officer (who may or may not have made the determination) during the period of the child’s or young person’s committal, in accordance with such requirements as may be prescribed, even though the variation may result in the child or young person being committed to a different care‑provider, if the Director‑General, protector or approved welfare officer (as the case may be) thinks that it is in the best interests of the child or young person to do so. [30/2019] (6) Where the Youth Court considers the presence of a child or young person or his or her parent or guardian to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of the proceedings, the Court may compel the attendance of the child or young person or his or her parent or guardian by summons. [30/2019] (7) Where the Youth Court requires further information to be provided as to the family background, general conduct, home environment, school record, medical history and state of development of the child or young person, the Court may order that the child or young person be committed to the care of such fit person or such place as may be determined by the Director‑General or a protector pending the receipt of such information by the Court. [30/2019] (8) Where — ( a ) a Youth Court has ordered the committal of a child or young person to the care of a fit person or a place of safety (called in this subsection and subsection (9) the principal care‑provider) under subsection (4)( b ) or ( c ); and ( b ) the principal care‑provider is unable to provide care for the child or young person for a period of at least 8 weeks, the Director‑General, a protector or an approved welfare officer may arrange for the child or young person to be committed to the temporary care of another fit person or a place of safety, whether or not the arrangement would result in the child or young person being committed to a different care‑provider for that period. [30/2019] (9) An arrangement by the Director‑General, a protector or an approved welfare officer under subsection (8) is not to be treated as a variation under subsection (5)( b ) if the child or young person is returned to the principal care‑provider before the end of the arrangement under subsection (8). [30/2019] (10) Where 3 variations have been made by the Director‑General, a protector or an approved welfare officer under subsection (5)( b ) in respect of a child or young person before the expiry of the period specified by the Youth Court under subsection (4)( b ) or ( c ) (as the case may be), and the Director‑General, a protector or an approved welfare officer is of the view that a further variation during that period is necessary, the Director‑General, protector or approved welfare officer must apply to the Court for an order as to the appropriate fit person to whom, or the appropriate place of safety to which, the child or young person is to be committed. [30/2019] (11) The Youth Court has the power to make one order or a combination of orders mentioned in subsection (4)( a ), ( b ) and ( c ) in relation to a child or young person concerned. [30/2019] (12) The duration of any order or any combination of orders made by the Youth Court under subsection (4) must not exceed a continuous period of 3 years. [30/2019] (13) Where a Youth Court makes any order mentioned in subsection (4)( a ), ( b ) and ( c ) — ( a ) a report on the living conditions of the child or young person, the standard of care and supervision provided to the child or young person, the progress made by the child or young person and such other matters as may be prescribed must be submitted to the Court within 6 months after the order is made, or such other period as the Court may specify in the order, by — (i) if the Court makes an order mentioned in subsection (4)( a ) — an approved welfare officer or a person appointed by the Court; (ii) if the Court makes an order mentioned in subsection (4)( b ) — (A) in the case where the fit person to whom the child or young person is committed is a relative of the child or young person — an approved welfare officer; or (B) in any other case — the fit person; or (iii) if the Court makes an order mentioned in subsection (4)( c ) — the care‑giver of the child or young person or an approved welfare officer; ( b ) the Court may, upon receiving the report mentioned in paragraph ( a ), order for one or more further reports to be submitted to the Court at such frequency as the Court may specify, for the purpose of monitoring the progress of the child or young person; and ( c ) the Court may order a parent or guardian of the child or young person to enter into a bond to undertake to commit his or her best efforts to exercise proper care and guardianship. [30/2019] (14) The provisions of section 54(8), (13), (14) and (15) apply, with the necessary modifications, in respect of an order made by the Youth Court under subsection (4) as they apply in respect of an order made by the Court under section 54(1). [30/2019] (15) The Youth Court may, on the application of the Director‑General, a protector or a parent or guardian of a child or young person in respect of whom an order under subsection (4) has been made, vary the period of the order or discharge the order if the Court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child or young person to do so. [30/2019] (16) To avoid doubt, where an order to be varied or discharged under subsection (15) involves a person who is older than 16 years of age (but below 19 years of age) at the time the order is to be varied or discharged, the Youth Court is not to extend the period for which the person is to be committed to the care of a fit person or to a place of safety, or placed under the supervision of an approved welfare officer or a person appointed by the Court, as the case may be. [30/2019] (17) An application made under subsection (1) may only be withdrawn with the consent of the Youth Court. [30/2019] (18) Where a parent or guardian of a child or young person fails to comply with any order of the Youth Court made under subsection (3)( b ), the parent or guardian shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000. [30/2019] (19) In this section — “family programme” means such family programme that is approved and specified by the Director‑General and which seeks to — ( a ) resolve any relationship problem between a child or young person and any parent, or where the child or young person has one or more guardians, any guardian, of the child or young person; ( b ) rehabilitate or assist in the rehabilitation of a child or young person; ( c ) enable any parent of a child or young person, or where the child or young person has one or more guardians, any of his or her guardians to manage the child or young person; or ( d ) enhance, promote or protect the physical, social and emotional wellbeing and safety of a child or young person; “recommendation”, in relation to a child or young person, means a document specifying the following: ( a ) the risks and requirements of the child or young person at a particular point in time; ( b ) the proposed activities and programmes that the child or young person or his or her parent or guardian, or both, should attend for the purpose of enabling the parent or guardian to address the risks and requirements raised about the child or young person at that point in time; ( c ) such other matters as may be prescribed; “young person” means a person who is 14 years of age or older but below 16 years of age.
