[40/2019] (2) Without limiting subsection (1) but subject to this section, an order under this section may, in particular, provide for — ( a ) the examination of witnesses, either orally or in writing; ( b ) the production of documents; ( c ) the inspection, photographing, preservation, custody or detention of any property; ( d ) the taking of samples of any property and the carrying out of any experiments on or with any property; ( e ) the medical examination of any person; and ( f ) without affecting paragraph ( e ), the taking and testing of samples of blood from any person. (3) An order under this section must not require any particular steps to be taken unless they are steps which can be required to be taken by way of obtaining evidence for the purposes of civil proceedings in the General Division of the High Court (whether or not they are proceedings of the same description as those to which the application for the order relates); but this subsection does not preclude the making of an order requiring a person to give testimony (either orally or in writing) otherwise than on oath where this is asked for by the requesting court. [40/2019] (4) An order under this section shall not require a person — ( a ) to state what documents relevant to the proceedings to which the application for the order relates are or have been in the person’s possession, custody or power; or ( b ) to produce any documents other than particular documents specified in the order as being documents appearing to the General Division of the High Court to be, or to be likely to be, in the person’s possession, custody or power. [40/2019] (5) A person who, by virtue of an order under this section, is required to attend at any place is entitled to the like payment for expenses and loss of time as on attendance as a witness in civil proceedings before the General Division of the High Court.

[40/2019] (2) Subsection (1)( b ) does not apply unless the claim of the person in question to be exempt from giving the evidence is either — ( a ) supported by a statement contained in the request (whether it is so supported unconditionally or subject to conditions that are fulfilled); or ( b ) conceded by the applicant for the order, and where such a claim made by any person is not so supported or conceded as provided in paragraph ( a ) or ( b ), the person may (subject to the other provisions of this section) be required to give the evidence to which the claim relates but that evidence is not to be transmitted to the requesting court if that court, on the matter being referred to it, upholds the claim. (3) Without affecting subsection (1), a person is not compelled by virtue of an order under section 4 to give any evidence if the person’s doing so would be prejudicial to the security of Singapore, and a certificate signed by or on behalf of the Minister to the effect that it would be so prejudicial for that person to do so is conclusive evidence of that fact. (4) In this section, references to giving evidence include references to answering any question and to producing any document and the reference in subsection (2) to the transmission of evidence given by a person is to be construed accordingly."
