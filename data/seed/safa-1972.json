[28/2009] (2) For the purposes of this Part, a punishment specified in a paragraph in subsection (1) is to be treated as less than the punishments specified in the paragraphs preceding that paragraph and greater than those specified in the paragraphs following that paragraph. (3) A person sentenced to death by a subordinate military court shall also be sentenced to discharge with ignominy. (4) An officer, a warrant officer or a military expert of or above the rank of ME3 who is sentenced by a subordinate military court to imprisonment or special detention in a disciplinary barrack or detention shall also be sentenced to discharge with ignominy but, if the subordinate military court fails to give effect to this subsection, the sentence is not invalid but is deemed to include a sentence of discharge with ignominy from the Singapore Armed Forces. [28/2009] (5) A soldier (other than a warrant officer or a military expert of the rank of ME3) or a non‑uniformed serviceman who is sentenced by a subordinate military court to imprisonment or special detention in a disciplinary barrack or detention may also be sentenced to discharge with ignominy. [28/2009] (6) A discharge with ignominy under this section does not affect the liability of any person to perform national service under the Enlistment Act 1970. (7) Subject to section 112(1), the amount of a fine that may be awarded must not exceed — ( a ) in the case of officers and senior military experts — a sum of $30,000; and [Act 24 of 2022 wef 28/10/2022] ( b ) in the case of soldiers and non-uniformed servicemen — a sum of $15,000, [Act 24 of 2022 wef 28/10/2022] and any such fine may, if the court orders, be paid by instalment to be deducted from the offender’s pay. [6/2006; 28/2009] (8) The Armed Forces Council may restore the whole or any part of any lost seniority or forfeited service in the case of a person subject to military law who has performed good and faithful service, or who may otherwise be deemed by the Armed Forces Council to merit such restoration. (9) A person subject to military law when sentenced to forfeiture of seniority of rank, and a person subject to military law when sentenced to forfeiture of all or any part of his or her service for the purposes of promotion, may also be sentenced to a reprimand. (10) Where a person subject to military law on active service is guilty of any offence, it is lawful for a subordinate military court to award for that offence such field punishment as may be prescribed in regulations made under this Act, and such field punishment may include confinement in such manner or place as may be so provided or such labour or employment as a person subject to military law could be subjected if the person were serving a sentence of imprisonment. (11) In addition to or in lieu of any other punishment in respect of an offence committed by a person subject to military law on active service, it is lawful for a subordinate military court to order that the offender forfeits all ordinary pay for a period not exceeding 3 months commencing from the date on which the sentence is awarded. (12) For the purpose of commutation of punishment, the field punishment mentioned in subsection (10) is deemed to be a less punishment than detention. (13) In addition to or in lieu of any other punishment in respect of any offence, an offender convicted by a subordinate military court may be subject to forfeiture of any military decoration or military award. (14) In addition to any of the punishments under subsection (1), a subordinate military court may order an accused person to pay to the party who sustained damage or loss through the offence compensation not exceeding $1,000. (15) Nothing in subsection (14) prejudices the right of any person to a civil remedy for the recovery of damages beyond the amount of compensation ordered. (16) In addition to or in lieu of any other punishment, where a person has been convicted of an offence under sections 17, 19, 21, 22, 23 and 47, a subordinate military court may sentence the person to caning not exceeding 12 strokes but such sentence must not be carried into effect unless confirmed by the Armed Forces Council. (16A) Where a subordinate military court sentences a person to caning under section 112(1), that sentence must not be carried into effect unless confirmed by the Armed Forces Council. [Act 24 of 2022 wef 28/10/2022] (17) Despite anything in this Act, where an operationally ready national serviceman has been convicted of an offence under section 17, 19, 25 or 26, the subordinate military court, if it is satisfied on the facts of the particular offence that the operationally ready national serviceman, by the serviceman’s behaviour, conduct or deportment, has shown during the period of operationally ready national service referred to in section 14(1)( b ) of the Enlistment Act 1970 that the serviceman is not responsive or amenable to military discipline, may — ( a ) in lieu of awarding the punishment prescribed by the section upon which the serviceman has been convicted or any less punishment authorised by this Act; and ( b ) in addition to the serviceman’s liability under section 14 of the Enlistment Act 1970, require the operationally ready national serviceman, to serve for such further period or periods of operationally ready national service not exceeding 12 months in the aggregate as the court may, in the circumstances of each particular case, decide. (18) The subordinate military court is to award the punishment referred to in subsection (17) only where it is satisfied that the operationally ready national serviceman is fit for operationally ready national service and considers that it is in the best interests of the Singapore Armed Forces that the operationally ready national serviceman should render a further period of operationally ready national service. (19) For the purposes of this Part, the punishment referred to in subsection (17) is to be treated as a less punishment than that specified in subsection (1)( e ) and is to be treated as a sentence imposed by a subordinate military court for purposes of review and appeal under this Act."

(3) Without affecting the provisions of this Act as to the imposition of deduction of pay as a punishment where, after enquiry by the Armed Forces Council or by a board of inquiry convened under Part 9, it appears that a loss of or damage to public or the Singapore Armed Forces property has been occasioned by any wrongful act or negligence of a serviceman, the Armed Forces Council may order the serviceman (whether or not the serviceman is a member of the Singapore Armed Forces when the order is made) to pay as or towards compensation for the loss or damage a sum that may be specified in the order and any such sum which is not otherwise paid by the serviceman may be deducted from the serviceman’s pay. (4) An order must not be made under subsection (3) if the serviceman in proceedings under this Act — ( a ) has been acquitted in circumstances involving a finding that the serviceman was not guilty of the wrongful act or negligence in question; or ( b ) has been awarded deduction of pay in respect of the same loss or damage."
