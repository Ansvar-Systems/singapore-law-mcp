(3) Where a subsequent determination varies or replaces an original determination so as to increase the amount of reimbursement that the purchaser was entitled to claim from the developer under the original determination, then the purchaser may — ( a ) set off the amount of the increase against any instalment or other payment payable by the purchaser to the developer under the affected agreement; and ( b ) take any action to recover from the developer, as a debt due to the purchaser, the amount of the increase (less any such set-off), and section 39J does not apply to the taking of any action under paragraph ( a ) or ( b ). (4) Where — ( a ) a subsequent determination varies or replaces an original determination so as to reduce the amount of reimbursement that the purchaser was entitled to claim from the developer under the original determination; and ( b ) the aggregate of the amount of set-off (if any) that the purchaser has effected under section 39K and the amount (if any) that the purchaser has recovered from the developer under that section, pursuant to the original determination, is in excess of the amount of the reimbursement that the developer is liable to pay the purchaser under the subsequent determination, that excess amount is recoverable by the developer as a debt due from the purchaser.
